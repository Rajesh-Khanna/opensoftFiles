</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>1 October 2007
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No. 4616 of 2007
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>1.  Although, ordinarily we would not have differed with the view taken by the High Court, but as the matter appears to be covered by a decision of this court in Rajesh Kumar v. Deputy, we are of the opinion that the High Court may consider the writ petition filed by the appellants herein on its own merits.
</p><p>2. Accordingly, the impugned judgment is set aside and the matter is remitted to the High Court for consideration of the writ petition afresh on its own merits. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
</p><p>Appeal disposed of.
