<div><h3>Ramabai (Dead) By Lrs v Moreshwar (Dead) By Lrs
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>3 November 2000
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.7402/2000
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>The notice on the special leave petition was issued.
</p><p>"...to show cause why the impugned judgment should not be set aside on the ground that the original plaintiff No.2 respondent No.4 in the second appeal who died pending the second appeal and when his heirs were not brought on record the second appeal had abated. Notice to issue on the application for condonation of delay also."
</p><p>1. Having heard learned counsel, we take the view that the order under challenge should be set aside and the matter restored to the High Court for re-consideration. We express no view on the aspect of abatement or otherwise.
</p><p>2.  The civil appeal is allowed. The appeal (Second Appeal No.313 of 1985) is restored to the file of the High Court to - 2 - be considered afresh. This shall be done expeditiously.
</p><p>3.  Pending the disposal of the appeal, the status quo as of today shall be maintained.
</p><p>No order as to costs.
</p><p>Appeals disposed of.
