The District Forum allowed the complaint and directed the appellants to pay Rs. 1, 97, 812/- with interest at the rate of 10% per annum. The appellants moved an application before the District Forum for recalling its order dated 3rd December 2001, which was dismissed on 22nd August, 2002. The appellant thereafter filed an appeal before the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Union Territory, Chandigarh (hereinafter referred to as 'the State Commission') along with an application to condone the delay of 102 days.

The case is remitted back to the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Union Territory, Chandigarh, for disposal of the appeal on merits.
