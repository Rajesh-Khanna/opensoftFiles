<div><h3>Commissioner of Income Tax v Nawanshahar Central Co-Operative Bank Limited
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>8 April 2005
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No. 2499 of 2005 and C.A. No. 2500 of 2005
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Delay condoned.
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>1.  This court has consistently held that investments made by a banking concern are part of the business of banking. The income arising from such investments would, therefore, be attributable to the business of bank falling under the head "Profits and gains of business" and thus deductible under section 80P(2)(a)(i) of the Income-tax Act 1961.
</p><p>2. This has been so held in Bihar State Co-operative Bank Ltd. v. CIT <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1960 Indlaw SC 41">1960 Indlaw SC 41</a>8"><a href="/case/1960 Indlaw SC 41">1960 Indlaw SC 41</a>8</a> , CIT v. Karnataka State Co-operative Apex Bank ; <a href="/case/2001 Indlaw SC 2">2001 Indlaw SC 2</a>82 and CIT v. Ramanathapuram District Co-operative Central Bank Ltd. <a href="/case/2001 Indlaw SC 2">2001 Indlaw SC 2</a>1068.
</p><p>3.  The principle in these cases would also cover a situation where a co-operative bank carrying on the business of banking is statutorily required to place a part of its funds in approved securities. The appeals are accordingly dismissed without costs.
</p><p>Appeals dismissed.
