</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>24 November 2000
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.18253/1999
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>1.  When the High Court has decided to entertain the appeal it was only in the fitness of things that the High Court should have maintained status-quo in respect of possession of the immovable property. Mr. A.S.Nambiar, learned senior counsel for the respondent made a plea that a direction may be given to the High Court to dispose of the appeal expeditiously. It is open to the respondent to move the High Court with such a request. With these observations we set aside the impugned order and direct that the execution of the decree impugned before the High Court will remain stayed till the disposal of the appeal now pending before the High Court.
</p><p>This appeal is disposed of accordingly.
</p><p>Appeal disposed of.
