<div><h3>Export Wel Industries and Others v Sai Nath Shipping Corporation and Others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>15 July 2003
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No. 786 of 1992
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  We have heard the parties. We have gone through the record. One of the questions involved is whether the first and second respondents were negligent in rendering the service in clearing the goods and/or whether it is the custom authorities who were negligent. We do not think that any complicated question of fact or law arise which required relegating a party to a civil suit.
</p><p>2. In our opinion, this is the question which can be decided by the National Commission Disputes Redressal Commission. As has been held by this Court in the cases of Charan Singh vs. Healing Touch Hospital and others (1986-2004 CONSUMER 7350 (NS) :  (NS) : <a href="/case/<a href="/case/2000 Indlaw SC 2">2000 Indlaw SC 2</a>669"><a href="/case/2000 Indlaw SC 2">2000 Indlaw SC 2</a>669</a>) and Dr. J.J. Merchant and others vs. Shrinath Chaturvedi (1986-2002 CONSUMER 6792 (NS):  (NS): <a href="/case/<a href="/case/<a href="/case/<a href="/case/2002 Indlaw SC 1">2002 Indlaw SC 1</a>7"><a href="/case/2002 Indlaw SC 1">2002 Indlaw SC 1</a>7</a>5"><a href="/case/<a href="/case/2002 Indlaw SC 1">2002 Indlaw SC 1</a>7"><a href="/case/2002 Indlaw SC 1">2002 Indlaw SC 1</a>7</a>5</a>7"><a href="/case/<a href="/case/<a href="/case/2002 Indlaw SC 1">2002 Indlaw SC 1</a>7"><a href="/case/2002 Indlaw SC 1">2002 Indlaw SC 1</a>7</a>5"><a href="/case/<a href="/case/2002 Indlaw SC 1">2002 Indlaw SC 1</a>7"><a href="/case/2002 Indlaw SC 1">2002 Indlaw SC 1</a>7</a>5</a>7</a>), if necessary, the Commission can record evidence.
</p><p>3.  We accordingly set aside the impugned order and remit the matter back to the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission for decision on merits. It is clarified that we have gone into the merits of the matter.
</p><p>4.  The appeal is accordingly allowed. There shall be no order as to costs.
</p><p>Appeal allowed.
