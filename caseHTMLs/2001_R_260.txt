</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 6734/2001
</p><p>The order of the court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  The order of pre-arrest bail has been granted by this court to this petitioner on a condition that he should surrender within six weeks. Unfortunately that period of six weeks expired on 24.8.2001 as the petitioner was away in a foreign country (Taiwan). He could reach India only on 25.8.2001. He applied for extension of time for surrender which was not granted.
