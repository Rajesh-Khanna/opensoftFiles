</p><p>The Order of the Court is as follows:
</p><p>1.  The principal question raised by learned counsel Mr. R. K. Garg for the petitioners is that the carry-forward rule should not be so worked as to confine the reservation in any particular year to 50 per cent of the vacancies available during the year. We think that this particular question requires consideration by a Constitution Bench of this Court. The papers will be placed before Hon'ble the Chief Justice for constituting a Constitution Bench of not less than five Hon'ble Judges.
</p><p>2.  Both the parties are agreed that the special leave petition be delinked. We order accordingly.
</p><p>Order accordingly.
