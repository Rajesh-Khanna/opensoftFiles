<div><h3>State of Uttar Pradesh v Kashi Prasad and Anr
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>7 January 2002
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 308/2001
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>1.  When the State wanted to file an appeal against an order of acquittal in a murder case they found that there was a delay of 22 days in moving for leave to appeal. That delay was not condoned by the High Court of Allahabad as per the impugned order.
</p><p>2.  The reason given by the High Court for refusal to condone the delay of 22 days is that addresses of the accused have not been furnished even at the time when the High Court took up the matter four and a half years later.
</p><p>3. Learned counsel for the State submitted that the addresses of the accused have been collected and this appeal was filed by showing such addresses. As a matter of fact respondents - accused appeared before us.We do not want an appeal filed by the State to be lost merely on the ground of the delay of 22 days.
</p><p>4.  We, therefore, allow this appeal and set aside the impugned order. The leave applied for will stand granted and the delay of 22 days will stand condoned.
</p><p>5. As the appeal has now become regularised it is open to the High Court to dispose of the appeal on merits.With the above directions and observations this appeal is allowed.
</p><p>Appeal allowed.
