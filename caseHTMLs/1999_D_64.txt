<div><h3>Dinesh Kumar Kartike v State of Madhya Pradesh and Others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>15 February 1999
</b><p>
</p><p>Cr.A. No. 180 of 1999 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 3890 of 1998)
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>1.  After hearing the counsel on both sides and after going into the facts, we are of the view that the following order would meet the ends of justice.
</p><p>2.  The appellant challenges an order of confiscation of truck bearing No. MPQ 6789. Notice was issued by this Court on 16-11-1998 calling upon the respondent to show cause why an appropriate order in terms of Section, 19(1)(b) of the Madhya Pradesh Van Upaj (Vyapar Viniyaman) Adhiniyam, 1969 should not be passed.
</p><p>Section 19(1)(b) of the Act reads as follows:
</p><p>"19. Composition of offences. - (1) The State Government may, by notification, empower a Forest Officer.
</p><p>(a) * * *
</p><p>(b) when any property other than a specified forest produce has been seized as liable to confiscation, to release the same on payment of the value thereof as estimated by such officer."
</p><p>3.  On a perusal of the SLP paper book, we find that the Forest Officer concerned had not focussed his attention on the enabling provision of Section 19(1)(b) of the Act.
</p><p>4. We therefore, direct the Forest Officer concerned to consider the question of release of the truck already confiscated under Section 19(1)(b) of the Act and pass appropriate orders in the facts and circumstances of the case. The appeal is disposed of accordingly. No orders as to costs.
</p><p>Appeal disposed of.
