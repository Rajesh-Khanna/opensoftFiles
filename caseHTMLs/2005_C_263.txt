<div><h3>Commissioner of Income Tax v Insilco Limited
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>9 August 2005
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No. 3976 of 2003
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  The grievance of the appellant is that the High Court, while admitting the appeal in respect of two assessment years under section 260A of the <a href="/acts/Income-tax Act, 1961">Income-tax Act, 1961</a>, directed that only the appeal relating to the assessment year 1990-1991 would be admitted.
</p><p>As far as the second assessment year 1991-1992 was concerned, the High Court was of the view that the issue had been correctly decided in favour of the assessee by the Tribunal relying upon the decisions of the Patna High Court in Ranchi Club Ltd. v. CIT 1995 Indlaw PAT 30 and Uday Mistanna Bhandar and Complex v. CIT 1996 Indlaw PAT 110 as affirmed by this court in CIT v. Ranchi Club Ltd. <a href="/case/2000 Indlaw SC 6">2000 Indlaw SC 6</a>45.
</p><p>2.  The appellant has said that Ranchi Club 1995 Indlaw PAT 30 was not an authority for the proposition as determined by the High Court and it erred in not admitting the appeal for the assessment year 1991-92. It is said that the decision of the High Court in Ranchi Club.
</p><p>3. The second ground on which the appellant has contended that the appeal should have been admitted is that the law laid down in Ranchi Club <a href="/case/2000 Indlaw SC 6">2000 Indlaw SC 6</a>45 had been changed by virtue of the decision of the Constitution Bench in CIT v. Anjum M. H. Ghaswala <a href="/case/2001 Indlaw SC 2">2001 Indlaw SC 2</a>0805.
</p><p>4.  Learned counsel appearing for the respondent on the other hand has urged that the decision of the Constitution Bench did not at all affect the earlier affirmation of the Ranchi Club case.
</p><p>5.  The appeal is allowed on this short ground and the matter remanded back to the High Court after admitting the appeal for the assessment year 1991-92.
</p><p>Appeal allowed.
