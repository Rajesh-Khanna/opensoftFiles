<div><h3>Sunder Lal v State of Rajasthan
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>7  May  2007
</b><p>The Judgment was delivered by :<i> Dr. Arijit Pasayat, J.
</i></p><p>
</p><p>Cr.A. No. 690 of 2007 and (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cr.)No. 4589 of 2006)
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>1. In this appeal judgment of a Division Bench of the Rajasthan High Court is the subject matter of challenge. The appellant was found guilty of offence punishable u/s. 302 of the <a href="/acts/Indian Penal Code, 1860">Indian Penal Code, 1860</a> (in short the 'IPC'), while the co-accused Laxmi Narain was found guilty of offence punishable u/s. 302 read with S. 34 IPC. Each
</p><p>of the accused was sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/- each with default stipulation. The trial Court's judgment of conviction & sentence was maintained.
</p><p>Background facts in a nutshell are as under:
</p><p>2. On 22 August 1998 a 'Parcha Bayan' (Ex.P20) of injured Heeralal (hereinafter referred to as the 'deceased') was recorded by the SHO, Police Station, Chechat, Distt. Kota, wherein it was stated that accused appellant Sunderlal told him as to why he has been abused. He told him that he should remove the stones. Subsequently in the night at about 2 a.m. when he was sleeping in his house, accused Sunderlal inflicted a blow on his head by 'Gandasi' with the intention to kill him and also inflicted injuries on his hand. He also stated that accused Laxmi Narain also inflicted injuries on his legs. When he cried Chaturbhuj, Deva, Rameshwar came but both the accused appellants ran away. On the basis of this 'Parcha Bayan' Police registered a case for offences under Sections 448, 307, 323 and 34 IPC. Subsequently, FIR No.125/1998 (Ex.P.22) was registered on 22 August 1998 itself. The injured was examined in the night itself at about 3 a.m. at Primary Health Centre, Chechat by Dr. Girish Chand (PW-1). The injured succumbed to the injuries at about 7 a.m. His post-mortem was conducted on 22 August 1998 itself by Dr. Ashok Mundara (P.W.22). The I.O. prepared the site plan and recorded the statements of the prosecution witnesses u/s. 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short the 'Code') The accused persons were arrested and on the basis of their information, the weapons i.e. gandasi and lathi were recovered. After death of Heera Lal the case was converted for offence punishable u/s. 302 IPC. After completion of the investigation, the police filed a challan against both the accused appellants. The case was committed and the trial Court framed the charges against the accused appellant Sunderlal for offence u/s. 302 IPC and appellant Laxmi Narain for offence u/s. 302 read with S. 34 IPC. Both the accused denied the charges and claimed to be tried.
</p><p>3. The trial Court found the evidence to be cogent and credible. The dying declaration was found to be reliable. The High Court found the judgment of the trial Court to be in order and dismissed the appeal. In support of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the High Court should not have placed reliance on the so called dying declaration. The same was not worthy of acceptance. Additionally, when the recovery has been disbelieved, the conviction solely on the highly improbable dying declaration should not have been made. Alternatively, it was submitted that offence u/s. 302 IPC has not been made out. In response, learned counsel for the respondent-State supported the order of the courts below.
</p><p>4. The dying declaration was recorded at 3.45 a.m. on 22 August 1998. It was categorically stated that he was sleeping in the night. The appellant came and assaulted him on his head with the gandasi with the intention of killing him and the co- accused Laxmi Narain inflicted injuries on his legs. The dying declaration was treated as the first FIR when the investigation was taken.
</p><p>5. At this juncture, it is relevant to take note of S. 32 of the <a href="/acts/Indian Evidence Act, 1872">Indian Evidence Act, 1872</a> (in short 'Evidence Act') Which deals with cases in which statement of relevant fact by person who is dead or cannot be found, etc. is relevant. The general rule is that all oral evidence must be direct viz., if it refers to a fact which could be seen it must be the evidence of the witness who says he saw it, if it refers to a fact which could be heard, it must be the evidence of the witness who says he heard it, if it refers to a fact which could be perceived by any other sense, it must be the evidence of the witness who says he perceived it by that sense. Similar is the case with opinion. These aspects are elaborated in S. 60 of the Evidence Act. The eighth clauses of S. 32 are exceptions to the general rule against hearsay just stated. Cl. (1) of S. 32 makes relevant what is generally described as dying declaration, though such an expression has not been used in any Statute. It essentially means statements made by a person as to the cause of his death or as to the circumstances of the transaction resulting in his death. The grounds of admission are: firstly, necessity for the victim being generally the only principal eye-witness to the crime, the exclusion of the statement might deflect the ends of justice; and secondly, the sense of impending death, which creates a sanction equal to the obligation of an oath. The general principle on which this species of evidence is admitted is that they are declarations made in extremity, when the party is at the point of death and when every hope of this world is gone, when every motive to falsehood is silenced, and the mind is induced by the most powerful considerations to speak the truth; a situation so solemn and so lawful is considered by the law as creating an obligation equal to that which is imposed by a positive oath administered in a Court of justice. These aspects have been eloquently stated by Lyre LCR in R. v. Wood Cock (1789) 1 Leach 500. Shakespeare makes the wounded Melun, finding himself disbelieved while announcing the intended treachery of the Dauphin Lewis explain:
</p><p>view,
</p><p>"Have I met hideous death within my Retaining but a quantity of life, Which bleeds away even as a form of wax, Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire? What is the world should make me now deceive, Since I must lose the use of all deceit? Why should I then be false since it is true That I must die here and live hence by truth?"
</p><p>The principle on which dying declaration is admitted in evidence is indicated in legal maxim "nemo moriturus proesumitur mentiri 'a man will not meet his maker with a lie in his mouth."
</p><p>6. This is a case where the basis of conviction of the accused is the dying declaration. The situation in which a person is on deathbed is so solemn and serene when he is dying that the grave position in which he is placed, is the reason in law to accept veracity of his statement. It is for this reason the requirements of oath and cross-examination are dispensed with. Besides, should the dying declaration be excluded it will result in miscarriage of justice because the victim being generally the only eye-witness in a serious crime, the exclusion of the statement would leave the Court without a scrap of evidence.
</p><p>7. Though a dying declaration is entitled to great weight, it is worthwhile to note that the accused has no power of cross-examination. Such a power is essential for eliciting the truth as an obligation of oath could be. This is the reason the Court also insists that the dying declaration should be of such a nature as to inspire full confidence of the Court in its correctness. The Court has to be on guard that the statement of deceased was not as a result of either tutoring, or prompting or a product of imagination. The Court must be further satisfied that the deceased was in a fit state of mind after a clear opportunity to observe and identify the assailant. Once the Court is satisfied that the declaration was true and voluntary, undoubtedly, it can base its conviction without any further corroboration. It cannot be laid down as an absolute rule of law that the dying declaration cannot form the sole basis of conviction unless it is corroborated. The rule requiring corroboration is merely a rule of prudence. This Court has laid down in several judgments the principles governing dying declaration, which could be summed up as under as indicated in Smt. Paniben v. State of Gujarat (AIR 1992 SC 1817 <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1992 Indlaw SC 9">1992 Indlaw SC 9</a>1"><a href="/case/1992 Indlaw SC 9">1992 Indlaw SC 9</a>1</a>9):
</p><p>(i) There is neither rule of law nor of prudence that dying declaration cannot be acted upon without corroboration. [See Munnu Raja & Anr. v. The State of Madhya Pradesh (1976) 2 SCR 764 <a href="/case/1975 Indlaw SC 280">1975 Indlaw SC 280</a>)]
</p><p>(ii) If the Court is satisfied that the dying declaration is true and voluntary it can base conviction on it, without corroboration. [See State of Uttar Pradesh v. Ram Sagar Yadav and Ors. (AIR 1985 SC 416) and Ramavati Devi v. State of Bihar (AIR 1983 SC 164)] <a href="/case/1983 Indlaw SC 4">1983 Indlaw SC 4</a>45
</p><p>(iii) The Court has to scrutinize the dying declaration carefully and must ensure that the declaration is not the result of tutoring, prompting or imagination. The deceased had an opportunity to observe and identify the assailants and was in a fit state to make the declaration. [See K. Ramachandra Reddy and Anr. v. The Public Prosecutor (AIR 1976 SC 1994) <a href="/case/1976 Indlaw SC 589">1976 Indlaw SC 589</a>]
</p><p>(iv) Where dying declaration is suspicious, it should not be acted upon without corroborative evidence. [See Rasheed Beg v. State of Madhya Pradesh (1974 (4) SCC 264)] <a href="/case/1973 Indlaw SC 38">1973 Indlaw SC 38</a>1
</p><p>(v) Where the deceased was unconscious and could never make any dying declaration the evidence with regard to it is to be rejected. [See Kaka Singh v State of M.P. (AIR 1982 SC 1021) <a href="/case/1981 Indlaw SC 16">1981 Indlaw SC 16</a>]
</p><p>(vi) A dying declaration which suffers from infirmity cannot form the basis of conviction. [See Ram Manorath and Ors. v. State of U.P. (1981 (2) SCC 654) <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1981 Indlaw SC 26">1981 Indlaw SC 26</a>9"><a href="/case/1981 Indlaw SC 26">1981 Indlaw SC 26</a>9</a>
</p><p>(vii) Merely because a dying declaration does contain the details as to the occurrence, it is not to be rejected. [See State of Maharashtra v. Krishnamurthi Laxmipati Naidu (AIR 1981 SC 617)] <a href="/case/1980 Indlaw SC 4">1980 Indlaw SC 4</a>1
</p><p>(viii) Equally, merely because it is a brief statement, it is not to be discarded. On the contrary, the shortness of the statement itself guarantees truth. [See Surajdeo Oza and Ors. v. State of Bihar (AIR 1979 SC 1505). <a href="/case/1979 Indlaw SC 4">1979 Indlaw SC 4</a>26
</p><p>(ix) Normally the Court in order to satisfy whether deceased was in a fit mental condition to make the dying declaration look up to the medical opinion. But where the eyewitness said that the deceased was in a fit and conscious state to make the dying declaration, the medical opinion cannot prevail. [See Nanahau Ram and Anr. v. State of Madhya Pradesh (AIR 1988 SC 912)]. <a href="/case/1988 Indlaw SC 37">1988 Indlaw SC 37</a>9
</p><p>(x) Where the prosecution version differs from the version as given in the dying declaration, the said declaration cannot be acted upon. [See State of U.P. v. Madan Mohan and Ors. (AIR 1989 SC 1519)]. <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1989 Indlaw SC 5">1989 Indlaw SC 5</a>83"><a href="/case/1989 Indlaw SC 5">1989 Indlaw SC 5</a>83</a>
</p><p>(xi) Where there are more than one statement in the nature of dying declaration, one first in point of time must be preferred. Of course, if the plurality of dying declaration could be held to be trustworthy and reliable, it has to be accepted. [See Mohanlal Gangaram Gehani v.State of Maharashtra (AIR 1982 SC 839)]
</p><p>8. In the light of the above principles, the acceptability of alleged dying declaration in the instant case has to be considered. The dying declaration is only a piece of untested evidence and must like any other evidence, satisfy the Court that what is stated therein is the unalloyed truth and that it is absolutely safe to act upon it. If after careful scrutiny the Court is satisfied that it is true and free from any effort to induce the deceased to make a false statement and if it is coherent and consistent, there shall be no legal impediment to make it basis of conviction, even if there is no corroboration. [See Gangotri Singh v. State of U.P.{JT 1992 (2)SC 417), Goverdhan Raoji Ghyare v. State of Maharashtra (JT 1993 (5) SC 87 <a href="/case/1993 Indlaw SC 1">1993 Indlaw SC 1</a>01), Meesala Ramakrishan v. State of Andhra Pradesh (JT 1994 (3) SC 232 <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1994 Indlaw SC 1">1994 Indlaw SC 1</a>476"><a href="/case/1994 Indlaw SC 1">1994 Indlaw SC 1</a>476</a>), State of Rajasthan v. Kishore (JT 1996 (2) SC 595) and Muthu Kutty and Anr. v. State by Inspector of Police, T.N. (2005 (9) SCC 113). <a href="/case/2004 Indlaw SC 1">2004 Indlaw SC 1</a>001
</p><p>9. This brings us to the crucial question as to which was the appropriate provision to be applied. It is stated that the occurrence took place at night with practically no light and therefore, no identification would have been possible. In the scheme of the IPC culpable homicide is genus and 'murder' its specie. All 'murder' is 'culpable homicide' but not vice-versa. Speaking generally, 'culpable homicide' sans 'special characteristics of murder is culpable homicide not amounting to murder'. For the purpose of fixing punishment, proportionate to the gravity of the generic offence, the IPC practically recognizes three degrees of culpable homicide. The first is, what may be called, 'culpable homicide of the first degree'. This is the gravest form of culpable homicide, which is defined in S. 300 as 'murder'. The second may be termed as 'culpable homicide of the second degree'. This is punishable under the first part of S. 304. Then, there is 'culpable homicide of the third degree'. This is the lowest type of culpable homicide and the punishment provided for it is also the lowest among the punishments provided for the three grades. Culpable homicide of this degree is punishable under the second part of S. 304.
</p><p>10. The academic distinction between 'murder' and 'culpable homicide not amounting to murder' has always vexed the Courts. The confusion is caused, if Courts losing sight of the true scope and meaning of the terms used by the legislature in these sections, allow themselves to be drawn into minute abstractions. The safest way of approach to the interpretation and application of these provisions seems to be to keep in focus the keywords used in the various clauses of Ss. 299 and 300. The following comparative table will be helpful in appreciating the points of distinction between the two offences.
</p><p>cl. (b) of S. 299 corresponds with cls. (2) and (3) of S. 300. The distinguishing feature of the mens rea requisite u/cl. (2) is the knowledge possessed by the offender regarding the particular victim being in such a peculiar condition or state of health that the internal harm caused to him is likely to be fatal, notwithstanding the fact that such harm would not in the ordinary way of nature be sufficient to cause death of a person in normal health or condition. It is noteworthy that the 'intention to cause death' is not an essential requirement of cl. (2). Only the intention of causing the bodily injury coupled with the offender's knowledge of the likelihood of such injury causing the death of the particular victim, is sufficient to bring the killing within the ambit of this clause. This aspect of cl. (2) is borne out by illustration (b) appended to S. 300.
</p><p>11. Cl. (b) of S. 299 does not postulate any such knowledge on the part of the offender. Instances of cases falling u/cl. (2) of S. 300 can be where the assailant causes death by a fist blow intentionally given knowing that the victim is suffering from an enlarged liver, or enlarged spleen or diseased heart and such blow is likely to cause death of that particular person as a result of the rupture of the liver, or spleen or the failure of the heart, as the case may be. If the assailant had no such knowledge about the disease or special frailty of the victim, nor an intention to cause death or bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, the offence will not be murder, even if the injury which caused the death, was intentionally given. In cl. (3) of Section 300, instead of the words 'likely to cause death' occurring in the corresponding cl. (b) of Section 299, the words "sufficient in the ordinary course of nature" have been used. Obviously, the distinction lies between a bodily injury likely to cause death and a bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The distinction is fine but real and if overlooked, may result in miscarriage of justice. The difference between cl. (b) of S. 299 and cl. (3) of S. 300 is one of the degree of probability of death resulting from the intended bodily injury. To put it more broadly, it is the degree of probability of death which determines whether a culpable homicide is of the gravest, medium or the lowest degree. The word 'likely' in cl. (b) of S. 299 conveys the sense of probable as distinguished from a mere possibility. The words "bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death" mean that death will be the "most probable" result of the injury, having regard to the ordinary course of nature.
</p><p>12. For cases to fall within clause (3), it is not necessary that the offender intended to cause death, so long as the death ensues from the intentional bodily injury or injuries sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. Rajwant and Anr. v. State of Kerala, (AIR 1966 SC 1874) <a href="/case/1966 Indlaw SC 91">1966 Indlaw SC 91</a> is an apt illustration of this point.
</p><p>13. In Virsa Singh v. State of Punjab, (AIR 1958 SC 465), <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1958 Indlaw SC 8">1958 Indlaw SC 8</a>2"><a href="/case/1958 Indlaw SC 8">1958 Indlaw SC 8</a>2</a> Vivian Bose, J. speaking for the Court, explained the meaning and scope of cl. (3). It was observed that the prosecution must prove the following facts before it can bring a case under Section 300, "thirdly". First, it must establish quite objectively, that a bodily injury is present; secondly the nature of the injury must be proved. These are purely objective investigations. Thirdly, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that particular injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or unintentional or that some other kind of injury was intended. Once these three elements are proved to be present, the enquiry proceeds further, and fourthly it must be proved that the injury of the type just described made up of the three elements set out above was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. This part of the enquiry is purely objective and inferential and has nothing to do with the intention of the offender.
</p><p>14. The ingredients of clause "Thirdly" of Section 300, IPC were brought out by the illustrious Judge in his terse language as follows:
</p><p>"To put it shortly, the prosecution must prove the following facts before it can bring a case under Section 300, "thirdly".
</p><p>First, it must establish, quite objectively, that a bodily injury is present.
</p><p>Secondly, the nature of the injury must be proved. These are purely objective investigations.
</p><p>Thirdly, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that particular bodily injury, that is to say that it was not accidental or unintentional, or that some other kind of injury was intended.
</p><p>Once these three elements are proved to be present, the enquiry proceeds further and, Fourthly, it must be proved that the injury of the type just described made up of the three elements set out above is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. This part of the enquiry is purely objective and inferential and has nothing to do with the intention of the offender."
</p><p>The learned Judge explained the third ingredient in the following words :
</p><p>"The question is not whether the prisoner intended to inflict a serious injury or a trivial one but whether he intended to inflict the injury that is proved to be present. If he can show that he did not, or if the totality of the circumstances justify such an inference, then of course, the intent that the section requires is not proved. But if there is nothing beyond the injury and the fact that the appellant inflicted it, the only possible inference is that he intended to inflict it. Whether he knew of its seriousness or intended serious consequences, is neither here or there. The question, so far as the intention is concerned, is not whether he intended to kill, or to inflict an injury of a particular degree of seriousness but whether he intended to inflict the injury in question and once the existence of the injury is proved the intention to cause it will be presumed unless the evidence or the circumstances warrant an opposite conclusion."
</p><p>15. These observations of Vivian Bose, J. have become locus classicus. The test laid down by Virsa Singh's case (supra) for the applicability of clause "Thirdly" is now ingrained in our legal system and has become part of the rule of law. Under clause thirdly of S. 300 IPC, culpable homicide is murder, if both the following conditions are satisfied: i.e. (a) that the act which causes death is done with the intention of causing death or is done with the intention of causing a bodily injury; and (b) that the injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. It must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that particular bodily injury which, in the ordinary course of nature, was sufficient to cause death, viz., that the injury found to be present was the injury that was intended to be inflicted. Thus, according to the rule laid down in Virsa Singh's case, even if the intention of accused was limited to the infliction of a bodily injury sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature, and did not extend to the intention of causing death, the offence would be murder. Illustration (c) appended to S. 300 clearly brings out this point.
</p><p>16. Cl. (c) of S. 299 and cl. (4) of S. 300 both require knowledge of the probability of the act causing death. It is not necessary for the purpose of this case to dilate much on the distinction between these corresponding clauses. It will be sufficient to say that cl. (4) of S. 300 would be applicable where the knowledge of the offender as to the probability of death of a person or persons in general as distinguished from a particular person or persons 'being caused from his imminently dangerous act, approximates to a practical certainty. Such knowledge on the part of the offender must be of the highest degree of probability, the act having been committed by the offender without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid.
</p><p>17. The above are only broad guidelines and not cast iron imperatives. In most cases, their observance will facilitate the task of the Court. But sometimes the facts are so intertwined and the second and the third stages so telescoped into each other that it may not be convenient to give a separate treatment to the matters involved in the second and third stages.
</p><p>18. The position was illuminatingly highlighted by this Court in State of Andhra Pradesh v. Rayavarapu Punnayya and Anr. (1976 (4) SCC 382) <a href="/case/1976 Indlaw SC 1">1976 Indlaw SC 1</a>92, Abdul Waheed Khan @ Waheed and Ors. v. State of Andhra Pradesh (JT 2002 (6) SC 274), <a href="/case/<a href="/case/<a href="/case/<a href="/case/2002 Indlaw SC 1">2002 Indlaw SC 1</a>7"><a href="/case/2002 Indlaw SC 1">2002 Indlaw SC 1</a>7</a>7"><a href="/case/<a href="/case/2002 Indlaw SC 1">2002 Indlaw SC 1</a>7"><a href="/case/2002 Indlaw SC 1">2002 Indlaw SC 1</a>7</a>7</a>7"><a href="/case/<a href="/case/<a href="/case/2002 Indlaw SC 1">2002 Indlaw SC 1</a>7"><a href="/case/2002 Indlaw SC 1">2002 Indlaw SC 1</a>7</a>7"><a href="/case/<a href="/case/2002 Indlaw SC 1">2002 Indlaw SC 1</a>7"><a href="/case/2002 Indlaw SC 1">2002 Indlaw SC 1</a>7</a>7</a>7</a> Augustine Saldanha v.

State of Tamil Nadu (2005 (9) SCC 650). <a href="/case/2004 Indlaw SC 1">2004 Indlaw SC 1</a>079
</p><p>19. Though the occurrence took place at night, the existence of light, however, feeble has been established. The accused and deceased were well known to each other. So identification by deceased, since he was seeing him from close quarters, is possible. If persons are known to each other, from the manner of walk, talking and peculiar features of gait identification is possible. The courts below have rightly held that deceased could have easily identified the accused persons.
</p><p>20. Considering the fact that the occurrence took place in the night in almost dark conditions with feeble light and attack was made indiscriminately, the appropriate conviction would be u/s. 304 Part I, IPC. Custodial sentence of 10 years would meet the ends of justice.
</p><p>The appeal is allowed to the aforesaid extent.
</p><p>Appeal partly allowed.
