The order of the Election Commission of India dated 12-3-1996 whereby registration was granted to a political party under the name of "All India Indira Congress" of which Respondents 2 and 3 were the President and Secretary respectively has been put in issue in this appeal on behalf of the Indian National Congress.
</p><p>2. Learned counsel appearing for Respondents 2 and 3 submits that the political party which they had formed under the name and style of "All India Indira Congress" has since been dissolved and, therefore, this appeal has been rendered infructuous.
</p><p>3.  No one appears on behalf of the appellant. Learned counsel appearing for the Election Commission of India does not join issue with the submission made on behalf of Respondents 2 and 3. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed as infructuous. No costs.
