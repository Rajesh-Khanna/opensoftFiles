<div><h3>Central Provident Fund Commissioner, New Delhi and others v Lala J. R. Education Society and others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>26 September 2016
</b><p>The Judgment was delivered by :<i> Kurian Joseph, J.
</i></p><p>
</p><p>Civil Appeal No. 9840 of 2016, Arising out of S. L. P. (C) No. 28796 of 2016 (Arising out of C. C No. 17728 of 2016)
</p><p>1. Delay condoned.
</p><p>2. Leave granted.
</p><p>3. Appellants are aggrieved since the application filed under Order VII, Rule 11, CPC has been rejected.
</p><p>4. According to the appellants, the respondents having exhausted all the remedies under the <a href="/acts/Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952">Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952</a>, cannot thereafter approach the Civil Court, which is barred under Section 7L(4) of the <a href="/acts/Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952">Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952</a>.
</p><p>5. On an application filed under Order VII, Rule 11, CPC, the Civil Court can only see the pleadings in the plaint and not anything else including written statement.
</p><p>6. The main grievance urged in the plaint is that the procedure under the Act has not been followed and, therefore, the appellants are entitled to file a suit. If that be so, the plaintiff is entitled to file a suit, as held by this Court in the case of Dhulabhai and Others Vs. The State of Madhya Pradesh and Anr. reported in (1968) 3 SCR 662 <a href="/case/1968 Indlaw SC 1">1968 Indlaw SC 1</a>37.
</p><p>7. According to the appellants, the respondents have suppressed crucial facts in the plaint, which if seen, the suit is only to be dismissed at the threshold. Rejection of a plaint on institutional grounds is different from dismissal of a suit at pre-trial stage on the ground of maintainability. For dismissal on a preliminary issue, the Court is entitled and liable to look into the entire documents including those furnished by the defendant.
</p><p>8. In view of the above observations, the appeal is dismissed.
</p><p>9. However, we permit the appellants to raise a preliminary issue on the maintainability of the suit, in which case, before proceeding with the trial, the trial court shall deal with the same in accordance with law.
</p><p>No costs.
</p><p>Appeal dismissed
