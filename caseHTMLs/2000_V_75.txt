</p><b>3 April 2000
</b><p>
</p><p>Cr.A. No. 325 of 2000.
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>1.  The order of learned Single Judge of Andhra Pradesh High Court passed in Criminal Revision No. 602/1999 allowing the revision filed by the accused persons on the ground that the criminal case cannot proceed because of the pendency of a civil suit is the subject-matter of the challenge in this Court.
</p><p>2.  As it appears, before the learned Magistrate, an application for discharge was filed, but the Magistrate was of the opinion that there exist sufficient material to proceed with the criminal case and therefore prayer for discharge was rejected. Accused then moved the High Court and High Court by the impugned order has quashed the criminal proceedings. The impugned proceedings is in relation to an allegation of an offence of cheating under S. 420 of the <a href="/acts/Indian Penal Code, 1860">Indian Penal Code, 1860</a>. The so-called civil suit is a suit for specific performance.
</p><p>3. We see no justification on the part of the High Court under such circumstances to direct that the criminal proceedings should be quashed. Moreso, there is an earlier order of the High Court itself.
</p><p>4.  In this view of the matter, we set aside the impugned order of the High Court and direct that the criminal proceedings should be continued. We make it clear that any observation made, will not bind the Magistrate.
</p><p>The appeal is disposed of.
</p><p>Appeal disposed of.
