<div><h3>Sadhu Singh and Another v R. S. Verma and Others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>13 November 2000
</b><p>
</p><p>Contempt Petition (C) No. 170 of 2000 In Ca No. 5325 of 1999
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  We have heard learned counsel for the parties and examined the responses filed by the respondents as also additional affidavits. Even if it be assumed that there is a genuine controversy with regard to the interpretation of judgments of this Court in Ajit Singh (II) v. State of Punjab <a href="/case/1999 Indlaw SC 7">1999 Indlaw SC 7</a>25 and Sube Singh Bahmani v. State of Haryana <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1999 Indlaw SC 7">1999 Indlaw SC 7</a>18"><a href="/case/1999 Indlaw SC 7">1999 Indlaw SC 7</a>18</a> recourse to contempt proceedings is not a proper course to resolve such a controversy. We are not satisfied that there has been any wilful disobedience of the orders of this Court.
</p><p>2. We, therefore, do not entertain the contempt petition. The contempt petition is, accordingly, dismissed.
</p><p>3.  We, however, clarify that the dismissal of this contempt petition shall not be construed as any expression of opinion on the issues raised in the petition and that it shall be open to the petitioners to take recourse to such other remedy in such forum as may be available to them in law.
</p><p>Petition dismissed.
