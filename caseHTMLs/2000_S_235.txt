</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No. 20123/1998 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 22 July 1998 in AA-35/97 of the High Court of A.P. at Hyderabad) with S.L.P. (C) Nos. 20868-20869 of 1998 and S.L.P. (C) Nos. 21063-21064 of 1998
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  Having heard learned counsel for the parties we find that the orders passed by the learned Single Judge have to be treated to have been passed under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act of 1940.
</p><p>2. Consequently, these orders immediately become appealable to Division Bench of the High Court under Section 39 and we, relegate the petitioner to that remedy.
</p><p>3.  It is obvious that the time taken in pursuing these Special Leave Petitions will be available to the petitioner for getting it excluded under Section 14 of the Limitation Act while appeals are filed.
</p><p>The Special Leave Petitions are disposed of accordingly.
</p><p>Petitions disposed of.
