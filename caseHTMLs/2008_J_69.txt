We direct the respondent-husband to give a lump sum compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- (two lakhs) to the petitioner-wife.
</p><p>3.  The payment of compensation shall be made within six months from today. If the payment is not made within the stipulated time, it will carry an interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the due date till the payment is made.
