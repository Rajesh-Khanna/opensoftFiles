</p><b>13 August 1993
</b><p>
</p><p>S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 1885-90 of 1987 [From the Judgment and Order Dt. 10 November 1986 of the High Court of Kerala in FMA Nos. 129, 131, 132, 185, 191 and 198 of 1982]
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  After spending considerable time in this case on the question of law, namely, whether the arbitrator had exceeded his jurisdiction in awarding the amount in question, the counsel on either side placed reliance on Sudarsan Trading Co. v. Govt. of Kerala <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1989 Indlaw SC 46">1989 Indlaw SC 46</a>3"><a href="/case/1989 Indlaw SC 46">1989 Indlaw SC 46</a>3</a>and to the contra position, the counsel appearing for the State of Kerala placed reliance on Associated Engg. Co. v. Govt. of A.P. <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1991 Indlaw SC 1">1991 Indlaw SC 1</a>0"><a href="/case/1991 Indlaw SC 1">1991 Indlaw SC 1</a>0</a>20 Prima facie, we are of the view that the view in these two decisions are mutually conflicting. Shri A.S. Nambiar, learned Senior Counsel has placed reliance on Hindustan Construction Co. Ltd. v. State of J and K <a href="/case/1992 Indlaw SC 5">1992 Indlaw SC 5</a>85 in which the ration in Sudarsan Trading Co. v. Govt. of Kerala <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1989 Indlaw SC 46">1989 Indlaw SC 46</a>3"><a href="/case/1989 Indlaw SC 46">1989 Indlaw SC 46</a>3</a> was practically approved. Sudarsan Trading Co. case <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1989 Indlaw SC 46">1989 Indlaw SC 46</a>3"><a href="/case/1989 Indlaw SC 46">1989 Indlaw SC 46</a>3</a> was not brought to the notice of the Court in Associated Engg. Co. case <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1991 Indlaw SC 1">1991 Indlaw SC 1</a>0"><a href="/case/1991 Indlaw SC 1">1991 Indlaw SC 1</a>0</a>20.
</p><p>2.   But however, in view of the apparent conflict of the abovesaid decisions, we deem it expedient that the matter may be referred to a three-Judge Bench for decision. The Registry is directed to post this matter before a Bench comprising three Hon'ble Judges.
</p><p>Order accordingly.
