</p><p>Civil Appeal No. 5952 of 2002
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows :
</p><p>1.  This matter has been placed before us for correcting typographical error in recording of the date of the judgment. Although the judgment was pronounced on September 08, 2009, by mistake the date thereof has been mentioned on the last page as September 08, 2008. This is nothing but a typographical error.
</p><p>2. Therefore, we direct that the date of judgment be corrected as September 08, 2009 instead of September 08, 2008.
</p><p>The office is directed to issue necessary corrigendum.
</p><p>Order accordingly
