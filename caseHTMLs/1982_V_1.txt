</p><p>The respondent Shri V.B. Raju, was a member of the Indian Civil Service and was a Judge first of the Bombay High Court and later of the Gujarat High Court. He was a Judge from June 12, 1959 to February 10, 1969 on which date he retired, He filed a writ petition in the Gujarat High Court claiming that he was entitled to be paid a pension of pounds 1000 sterling in addition to the additional pension payable under Part II of the First Schedule to the <a href="/acts/High Court Judges (Conditions of Service) Act, 1954">High Court Judges (Conditions of Service) Act, 1954</a> <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1974 Indlaw SC 1">1974 Indlaw SC 1</a>2"><a href="/case/1974 Indlaw SC 1">1974 Indlaw SC 1</a>2</a>6<a href="/case/<a href="/case/1974 Indlaw SC 1">1974 Indlaw SC 1</a>2"><a href="/case/1974 Indlaw SC 1">1974 Indlaw SC 1</a>2</a>6<a href="/case/<a href="/case/1974 Indlaw SC 1">1974 Indlaw SC 1</a>2"><a href="/case/1974 Indlaw SC 1">1974 Indlaw SC 1</a>2</a>6<a href="/case/<a href="/case/1974 Indlaw SC 1">1974 Indlaw SC 1</a>2"><a href="/case/1974 Indlaw SC 1">1974 Indlaw SC 1</a>2</a>6. In view of the judgment of this Court in V.B. Raju v. State of Gujarat <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1974 Indlaw SC 1">1974 Indlaw SC 1</a>2"><a href="/case/1974 Indlaw SC 1">1974 Indlaw SC 1</a>2</a>6<a href="/case/<a href="/case/1974 Indlaw SC 1">1974 Indlaw SC 1</a>2"><a href="/case/1974 Indlaw SC 1">1974 Indlaw SC 1</a>2</a>6<a href="/case/<a href="/case/1974 Indlaw SC 1">1974 Indlaw SC 1</a>2"><a href="/case/1974 Indlaw SC 1">1974 Indlaw SC 1</a>2</a>6<a href="/case/<a href="/case/1974 Indlaw SC 1">1974 Indlaw SC 1</a>2"><a href="/case/1974 Indlaw SC 1">1974 Indlaw SC 1</a>2</a>6, this appeal has to be allowed. It was however, argued by Shri V.B. Raju, in the case now before us, that in the earlier judgment of the Supreme Court there was no reference to the <a href="/acts/High Court Judges (Conditions of Service) Act, 1954">High Court Judges (Conditions of Service) Act, 1954</a>
</p><p>Shri Raju raised a preliminary objection that in view of Article 312-A(3) of the Constitution which came into force w.e.f. August 29, 1972 the present appeal by the Union of India was not maintainable. We see no force in the submission. The action out of which the appeal arises was instituted prior to August 29, 1972 and the Union of India had a vested right of appeal vide Garikapatti Veeraya v. N. Subbiah Choudhury <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1957 Indlaw SC 16">1957 Indlaw SC 16</a>0"><a href="/case/1957 Indlaw SC 16">1957 Indlaw SC 16</a>0</a><a href="/case/<a href="/case/1957 Indlaw SC 16">1957 Indlaw SC 16</a>0"><a href="/case/1957 Indlaw SC 16">1957 Indlaw SC 16</a>0</a><a href="/case/<a href="/case/1957 Indlaw SC 16">1957 Indlaw SC 16</a>0"><a href="/case/1957 Indlaw SC 16">1957 Indlaw SC 16</a>0</a>.
</p><p>1. The appeal is therefore allowed, and the writ petition in the High Court is dismissed.
</p><p>There will be no order as to costs.
</p><p>Appeal allowed.
