<div><h3>State of Rajasthan and Others v Teeja Devi and Others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>26 March 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.11458/2000
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  The implementation of order dated 27/5/1993 being the subject matter and that order having become final, the decision in Godavraman's case will be of no assistance. That apart, it has been averred in the counter affidavit that the land in question is a barren land without having any tree thereon.
</p><p>2. The dispute seems to be a dispute between the two departments of the government, namely, Colonization Department and Forest Department. We really deprecate the inter se dispute between the two departments of the government coming to Court. This special leave petition is dismissed accordingly.
</p><p>Petition dismissed.
