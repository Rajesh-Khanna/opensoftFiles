</p><p>1. Heard the learned counsel.
</p><p>2. Leave granted.

We are impressed by only one submission made by the learned counsel for the appellant that the trial court did not consider the provisions of the amended Section 83 of the <a href="/acts/Wakf Act, 1995">Wakf Act, 1995</a>, while relying upon the judgment delivered in Faseela M.

The said judgment pertains to a case filed prior to the amendment of Section 83 of the <a href="/acts/Wakf Act, 1995">Wakf Act, 1995</a>.
</p><p>4. In the circumstances, in our opinion, it would be just and appropriate to remit the matter to the trial court to consider the provisions of Section 83 of the <a href="/acts/Wakf Act, 1995">Wakf Act, 1995</a> and take appropriate decision in accordance with law.
</p><p>5. We, therefore, set aside the impugned order passed by the High Court whereby the order of the trial court has been confirmed.
