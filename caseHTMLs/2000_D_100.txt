<div><h3>Raj Laxmi Sharma v Dilip Kumar Sharma
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>10 January 2000
</b><p>
</p><p>Transfer Petn. (C) No. 778 of 1999
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  This is a wife's petition to transfer the suit for dissolution of marriage filed by the husband against her in the Court of the Judicial Magistrate, Ranchi to Agra. It is the case of the wife that she stays with her father in Agra along with the two sons of the marriage, who are aged eight and ten years. It would not be possible for her to travel from time to time from Agra to Ranchi to defend the proceedings and she would not be able to travel alone.
</p><p>2. Our attention has been drawn by learned counsel for the husband to a letter dated 22nd December, 1993, which is said to be fabricated. It is submitted that there re other letters of a similar kind on the record and that, therefore, we should not entertain the transfer petition because it is filed by a person who has come to the Court with unclean hands.
</p><p>2. We are not inclined to reject the wife's petition only upon this ground. No issue relating to these letters is not  us and whether or not they are forged must be gone into in appropriate proceedings, if necessary.
</p><p>3. So far as we are concerned, the wife has made out a case for transfer. We do not agree that the Court to which the proceedings are transferred should not be located in the State of Uttar Pradesh. We think that, in the circumstances, it is appropriate that the Court to which the proceedings are transferred should be located where the petitioner now stays.
</p><p>4. The transfer petition is, therefore, made absolute and Matrimonial Case No. 35 of 1999 filed in the Court of the Judicial Magistrate, Ranchi shall stand transferred to the Family Court at Agra, Uttar Pradesh.
</p><p>5. No order as to costs.
</p><p>Order accordingly
