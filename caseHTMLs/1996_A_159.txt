<div><h3>Aruna Steel Rolling Mills v Collector of Central Excise, Madurai
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>12 December 1996
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No. 3064 of 1989
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  The appellants impugn the judgment and order of the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal on the ground that their products, tie-bars, fall within Tariff Item 26AA(i)(a) which refers, for our purposes, to bars and all other forged shapes and sections not otherwise specified. Their argument is that the tie bars are forged. This was not a case that was advanced before the Assistant Collector and no evidence in this behalf was led.
</p><p>2. The Appellate Collector, in terms, found that the tie bars under consideration were not manufactured by forging. The Tribunal proceeded upon the same basis.
</p><p>3.  The appeal must, therefore, be dismissed, with no order as to costs.
</p><p>Appeal dismissed.
