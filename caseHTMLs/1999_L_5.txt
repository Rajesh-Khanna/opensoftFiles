<div><h3>State of Karnataka v L. Shivanna and others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>14 October 1999
</b><p>
</p><p>C.As. Nos. 276-77 of 1993
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Civil Appeal No. 277 of 1993
</p><p>1.  Learned counsel seeks to withdraw this appeal. Civil Appeal No. 277 of 1993 is, accordingly, dismissed as withdrawn.
</p><p>Civil Appeal No. 276 of 1993
</p><p>2.  The High Court, by the impugned order in Writ Petition No. 8888 of 1988 interpreted Section 139 of the Karnataka Zilla Parishads, Taluk Panchayat Samithis, Mandal Panchayats and Nyaya Panchayats Act, 1983. It is not disputed before us that the aforesaid Act has since been repealed by the Karnataka Panchayat Raj Act, 1993.
</p><p>3. In this view of the matter, the question relating to the interpretation of Section 139 of the repealed Act does not require any further consideration by us and we need not detain ourselves to decide an academic issue. We express no opinion on the correctness or otherwise of the interpretation placed by the High Court on Section 139 of the repealed Act.
</p><p>The appeal is, therefore, dismissed. No costs.
</p><p>Appeal dismissed.
