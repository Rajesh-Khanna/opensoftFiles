</p><p>1.  By IA No. 2, it is reported that the parties have arrived at a settlement. The memorandum of understanding has been signed between the parties. The petitioner wife is in Delhi and the respondent husband, a resident of Chennai, is presently in Boston (USA). It is stated at the Bar that the parties have agreed to dissolve the marriage by mutual consent. The question that remains to be examined is whether the respondent husband should personally appear for giving his consent to a decree based on such consent being passed or whether he can authorise someone to make a statement in that regard and enable the court passing the consent decree.
</p><p>2.  Whether the matter is in Delhi or in Chennai, the fact remains that the respondent himself or a person authorised by him depending on the order which the trial court may make, shall have to appear before the court.
