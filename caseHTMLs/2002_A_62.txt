<div><h3>Commissioner of Income Tax v Alok Enterprises
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>12 November 2002
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No. 2004 of 2000, I. T. A. No. 62 of 1997
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  The present appeal is from the decision of the High Court refusing to exercise powers under section 256(2) of the <a href="/acts/Income-tax Act, 1961">Income-tax Act, 1961</a> (the "Act"), in view of the earlier decision of the same High Court, namely (CIT v. Pratap-garh Cold Storage and Ice Factory 1982 UPTC 129 ).
</p><p>The question which arose for decision was :
</p><p>"Whether, the assessee will be entitled to the benefit for carry forward of loss to be set off in subsequent years even if thereturn of loss is filed beyond the time prescribed under section139(3) of the <a href="/acts/Income-tax Act, 1961">Income-tax Act, 1961</a> ?"
</p><p>2.  Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has drawn our attention to the fact that the decision in Pratapgarh Cold Storage 1982 UPTC 129 has proceeded on the basis of this court in CIT v.Kulu Valley Transport Co. P. Ltd. <a href="/case/1970 Indlaw SC 73">1970 Indlaw SC 73</a>.
</p><p>3.  It appears that the decision in Kulu Valley Transport <a href="/case/1970 Indlaw SC 73">1970 Indlaw SC 73</a> (SC) was based upon an interpretation of the provisions ofsection 22 of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922.
</p><p>4. The language of section 22 and section 139, sub-sections (3) and (4) of the Act do not prima facie appear to be pari materia and it cannot be said that the question raised by the Revenue is not an arguable one.
</p><p>5.  We accordingly allow the appeal and set aside the order of theHigh Court and direct the Tribunal to state the case and refer it tothe High Court for its decision under section 256(2) of the said Act.
</p><p>Appeal allowed.
