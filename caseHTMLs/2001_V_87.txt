</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>12 February 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 47/2001
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>1.  We heard both sides. The appellant is a doctor attached to JJ Hospital, Bombay and his wife is also a doctor.
</p><p>2.  It appears that there were skirmishes between them and now at the instance of the wife a prosecution has been launched against this appellant-doctor under section 498(A) of the IPC besides Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.
</p><p>3. When appellant applied for anticipatory bail, the same was refused by the High Court.We do not find any reason why the anticipatory bail applied for by the appellant should be denied to him particularly in the nature of the offence alleged against him.
</p><p>4.  We, therefore, order that appellant, if arrested, shall be realeased on bail on executing a bond to the satisfaction of the arresting officer. The Appeal is disposed of accordingly.
</p><p>Appeal disposed of.
