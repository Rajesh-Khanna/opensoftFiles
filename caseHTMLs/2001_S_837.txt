</p><b>11 April 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20456-20457/2000
</p><p>The order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  Having heard Mr. Nageswara Rao, the learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners, at length, we see no infirmity with the impugned order of the High Court so as to be interfered with by this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution of India.
</p><p>2. It appears to us that the accused persons are trying to evade and prolong the trial. The concerned Sessions Judge is directed to conclude the proceedings as expeditiously as possible, particularly in view of the gravity of charges.
</p><p>The Special Leave Petitions accordingly stand dismissed.
</p><p>Petitions dismissed.
