</p><p>C.A. No. 3634 of 2000 (Arising as an appeal From 2002 (147) E.L.T. 1069 (Tribunal); 2003 (151) E.L.T. A85 (S.C.) With C.A. Nos. 5043/2000 (Arising as an appeal From 2000 (115) E.L.T. 668 (Tribunal)) and 4042/2002
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Heard learned counsel for the parties.
</p><p>1.  The Tribunal allowed the appeal filed by the assessee by referring to its earlier decision in A/1038/99-NB(SM), dated 24-9-99 wherein it was held that press-mud would not be a marketable commodity and therefore not excisable.
</p><p>Admittedly, the Department has accepted the decision rendered by the Tribunal in Shankar Sugar Mills and has not challenged the same.
</p><p>2. Further, the Department has not led any evidence to establish that press-mud was in any way marketable commodity. Hence these appeals are dismissed.
</p><p>There shall not be any order as to costs.
</p><p>Appeals dismissed.
