<div><h3>Wakil Prasad Yadav v Union of India and Others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>16 July 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.7606/2000
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>1.  The High Court declined to interfere in the civil revision petition filed by the present appellant on the ground that it did not find any reason to interfere with the impugned order that had been passed by the First Subordinate Judge, Dhanbad. Having heard learned counsel, we are of the view that the matter requires the consideration of the High Court.
</p><p>2.  We do not go into details because we do not wish to prejudice the case on either side.
</p><p>3. Accordingly, the civil appeal is allowed. The order under challenge is set aside. The civil revision petition (C.R. No.44 of 1999) is restored to the file of the High Court at Ranchi to be heard and disposed of on merits.
</p><p>No order as to costs.
</p><p>Appeal allowed.
