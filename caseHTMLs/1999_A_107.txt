<div><h3>Annie Varghese and Others v State of Kerala and Others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>23 July 1999
</b><p>
</p><p>S.L.Ps. (C) No. 8751 of 1999 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 10 February 1999 in LAA No. 908 of 1994 of the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam) with No. 8765 of 1999
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  The only grievance of the petitioners is that the High Court has dis-allowed interest on solatium. Learned counsel submits that the question whether interest on solatium can be granted is now pending before the Constitution Bench of this Court. We do not think that it would be worthwhile to grant special leave in this case solely on the ground that a question of law on that aspect is pending before a Constitution Bench of this Court.
</p><p>2. In case the Constitution Bench upholds the contention that interest on solatium is to be granted we permit the petitioners to move the High Court to amend the judgment and decree for carrying out the legal position declared by the Constitution Bench in that regard.
</p><p>3.  If any such motion is made for amendment after the Constitution Bench renders the decision the High Court will pass appropriate orders to make the judgment in tune with the law so declared by the Court. This rider is enough to safeguard the interests of the petitioners.
</p><p>With the above observations these SLPs are disposed of.
</p><p>Petitions disposed of.
