<div><h3>State of Chhattisgarh and Others v S.J. Shrivastav
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>29 February 2008
</b><p>
</p><p>Appeal (civil) 1692 of 2008(Arising Out of S.L.P.(C) No.4169 of 2008)
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows :
</p><p>Issue notice.
</p><p>1.  Mr. Ravindra Shrivastava, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent-caveat or accepts notice. We have heard learned counsels for the parties.
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>2.  This appeal is directed against the judgment and interim order dated 21.11.2007 passed by the High Court of Chhattisgarh at Bilaspur in Writ Appeal No.255 of 2007 staying the transfer of incumbent from one place to another. Normally the Courts should not interfere in transfer matters unless there are very very compelling circumstances. Therefore, the interim order passed by the High Court staying the transfer of the respondent was not correct.
</p><p>3.  In the facts and circumstances of the case, we set aside the interim order dated 21.11.2007 passed by the High Court and direct that the Writ Appeal itself be heard and disposed of expeditiously as far as possible within three months.
</p><p>This appeal is accordingly, disposed of.
</p><p>Appeal disposed of.
