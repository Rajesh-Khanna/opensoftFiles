<div><h3>Vassudeo B. Morajkar v Jose Maria F. Xavier C. Luis (Dead) By Lrs.
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>2 March 2005
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No. 6547 of 1999
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  Having failed to get an injunction from the Mamlatdar i.e. an authority constituted under the  Goa,Daman and Din Agricultural Tenancy Act,1964 (GDD Act 7 of 1964) (hereinafter referred to as "the Act"), the appellant filed civil suit seeking injunction restraining the respondents from interfering with his possession.
</p><p>2. The High Court has held that the civil court would have no jurisdiction to try such a suit in view of the bar created to the filing of the suit in the civil court under Section 58 of the Act. Under Section 8-A of the Act, the jurisdiction for relief in cases of threatened wrongful dispossession of a tenant is given to the Mamlatdar, an authority constituted under the Act.
</p><p>3.  We agree with the view taken by the High Court. No ground is made out to interfere in the said order.
</p><p>The civil appeal is dismissed with no order as to costs.
</p><p>Appeal dismissed.
