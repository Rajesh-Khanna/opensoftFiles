<div><h3>Kiran Agarwal v High Court of Himachal Pradesh and others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>10 December 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No. 20579/2001
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  At no stage, prior to the commencement of the disciplinary proceedings or during the course thereof, did the petitioner address any communication to the authorities nor did she appear.
</p><p>2.  We do not, therefore, consider it an appropriate case to consider the averment that the wrong rule has been applied; this could have been pointed out but was not.
</p><p>3.  The High Court has, in the impugned judgment, fairly taken the view that the punishment originally imposed was disproportionate to the offence of which the petitioner had been found guilty.
</p><p>4. Now, we do not see any reason to interfere, even in regard to the punishment which has subsequently been imposed. The special leave petition is dismissed.
</p><p>Petition dismissed.
