<div><h3>Managing Director, Andhra Pradesh SRTC and another v B. Bangaramma
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>21 August 1998
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No. 4297 of 1998
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>Heard learned counsel for the parties.
</p><p>1.  It is now well settled that ordinarily the courts shall not direct the employer to create a new post and appoint kith and kin of the ex-employee on compassionate grounds. The High Court was wrong in directing the appellants to create one post and appoint the respondent on that post on compassionate grounds.
</p><p>2. Therefore, we allow this appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court. Still, it will be open to the appellants to accommodate her if there is any vacant post and it is otherwise possible to do so.
</p><p>Appeal allowed.
