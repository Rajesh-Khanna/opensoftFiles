</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>9 April 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>W.P. (C) No. 239 of 1998
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  After hearing learned counsel for the parties, it appears that the following questions may also fall for decision in the writ petition, besides other questions:
</p><p>(1) Whether legally obliging the singing of national anthem in an assembly by all those present in the assembly when the national anthem is sung is unconstitutional?
</p><p>(2) Does the judgment in Bijoe Emmanuel v. State of Kerala <a href="/case/1986 Indlaw SC 6">1986 Indlaw SC 6</a>26 require reconsideration?
</p><p>2.  The writ petition is, therefore, required to be heard by a Constitution Bench.
</p><p>3. We, accordingly, refer the writ petition to be heard by a Constitution Bench. Keeping in view the importance of the issues, it is desirable that the writ petition is heard at an early date.
</p><p>4.  Let the papers be placed before the Hon'ble Chief Justice for constitution of the Bench.
</p><p>Order accordingly.
