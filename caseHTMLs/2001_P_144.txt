<div><h3>M.P. State Road Transport Corporation v Prakash Chandra Purohit and Others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>25 January 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>IA No 2 In C.A..No.3378/2000
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  This Civil Appeal is directed against an interim order passed by the Madhya Pradesh High Court in a pending Writ Petition before it. This Court while granting leave has stayed the said interim order.
</p><p>2. The counsel appearing for the Writ Petitioner states that the Writ Petition itself has become infructuous, and therefore the same will not be pressed before the High Court. Since the Writ Petition itself is not being pressed as being infructuous, there is no justification for continuing the Civil Appeal in this Court.
</p><p>3.  The Civil Appeal accordingly stands disposed of. Needless to mention the interim order, which had been granted by this Court, will be operative till so long as the Writ Petition is not withdrawn or dismissed as infructuous in the High Court.
</p><p>The record be sent back immediately to the High Court.
</p><p>Appeal disposed of.
