<div><h3>Commissioner of Income Tax v Amalgamations Limited
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>15 July 1997
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No. 4683 of 1997 with S.L.P (Civil) No. 14332 of 1986 (From the judgment and order Dt. 12 August 1986 of the Madras High Court in TCP No. 302 of 1985)
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>1. The question raised before the High Court for reference was "whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in holding that the assessee is entitled to interest under s. 214 from 1st April, 1970 to 31st August, 1978, the date of completion of the set aside assessment even though the regular assessment was made on 28th December, 1970, in the assessee's case."
</p><p>2. There was sharp difference of opinion among the High Courts as to the interpretation of s. 214. It is very surprising that the High Court did not think that this was a question of law which should be gone into and decided by the High Court itself.
</p><p>3. In any event the controversy now stands concluded by the decision of this Court in the case of Modi Industries Ltd. vs. CIT <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1995 Indlaw SC 1">1995 Indlaw SC 1</a>529"><a href="/case/1995 Indlaw SC 1">1995 Indlaw SC 1</a>529</a>.
</p><p>4. Therefore, we do not propose to send the case back to the High Court for examining the issue. We treat the question as to have been referred before this Court and we answer the question in favour of the Revenue. The appeal is allowed. No order as to costs.
</p><p>Appeal allowed.
