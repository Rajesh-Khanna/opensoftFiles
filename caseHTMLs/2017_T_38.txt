<div><h3>Tuppadahalli Energy India Private Limited v Karnataka Elec. Reg. Comm. and another
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>10 January 2017
</b><p>The Judgment was delivered by :<i> Kurian Joseph, J.
</i></p><p>
</p><p>Civil Appeal No. 8736 of 2013, Civil Appeal Nos. 10290-10291 of 2014
</p><p>1. On the interpretation of Clause 6.5 of the Power Purchase Agreement, both the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) and the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) have taken a view that it is actually an incentive for the prompt payment of the monthly tariff invoice. Though Sh.S.Ganesh, learned senior counsel, persuasively submitted that it is only a one-time expenditure contemplated under the Power Purchase Agreement, we too are unable to accept the contention.
</p><p>2. No doubt, there is a provision under Clause 6.2 for interest on belated payment, but Clause 6.5(v) is actually a rebate for prompt payment of the monthly invoice. The view thus taken by the KERC and the APTEL, being a plausible view, we do not find any substantial question of law so as to warrant us to exercise our powers under Section 125 of the <a href="/acts/Electricity Act, 2003">Electricity Act, 2003</a>.
</p><p>3. The appeals are, accordingly, dismissed.
</p><p>4. No costs.
</p><p>Appeals dismissed
