<div><h3>State of Punjab and Another v Asha Mehta
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>9 November 1995
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No. 3863 of 1993
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  The question whether 32.5% could be rounded off to 33% is purely an arithmetical calculation, a procedure which the Public Service Commission in fairness has been adopting in all other cases. The High Court had noticed this aspect of the matter and also relied upon earlier precedents in support thereof.
</p><p>In that view of the matter, we do not think that it is a fit case for a interference under Article 136 of the Constitution.
</p><p>The appeal is dismissed. No costs.
</p><p>Appeal dismissed.
