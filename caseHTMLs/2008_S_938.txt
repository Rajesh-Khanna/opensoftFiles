</p><p>1.  In view of our order passed today in the case of M/s. Supreme Industries Ltd. Vs. M/s. Ranisati Pipe Industries & Ors., <a href="/case/2008 Indlaw SC 2">2008 Indlaw SC 2</a>336 Civil Appeal arising out of S.L.P.(C) No.8750/2007, nothing survives in this Petition filed by M/s. Farmers Tractors. The reason is that petitioners-M/s. Farmers Tractors were intervenors in the High Court. They had opposed the original Writ Petition filed by respondent No.5 herein- M/s.Ranisati Pipe Industries. Since the original Writ Petition sands dismissed as withdrawn, nothing survives in this Special Leave Petition and the same is, accordingly, dismissed as infructuous.
</p><p>No orders as to costs.
