</p><p>5.  The delay was only 55 days, and the officer of the State had filed an affidavit explaining the cause of delay and there was reasonable ground for filing the application for delay and the learned Single Judge should have considered the same and granted the application for condonation of delay.
</p><p>6.  We set aside the order passed by the learned Single Judge and direct that delay be condoned and the appeal be restored to its file and be disposed of in accordance with law.
</p><p>The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
