<div><h3>R.S. Jakhod v Balwan Singh
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>7 January 2009
</b><p>
</p><p>CIVIL APPEAL NO.4437 OF 2006
</p><p>1. Heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant and the respondent, who has appeared in-person.
</p><p>2. By the impugned order, the Disciplinary Committee of Bar Council of India found the appellant guilty of professional misconduct and directed that his name be removed from the rolls of the State Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana.
</p><p>3. On 31st October, 2006, notice was issued only on the quantum of punishment. At that time, operation of the impugned order was not stayed.
</p><p>Having heard learned counsel for the appellant and the respondent and perused the records, we are of the view that, in the facts and circumstances of the case, it would be just and expedient if the punishment of removal of the appellant's name from the rolls of the State Bar Council is substituted with that of suspension of his licence for a period of six months from today.
</p><p>4. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed in-part and, while upholding the finding of processional misconduct, we set aside the direction given for removal of the appellant's name from the rolls of the State Bar Council and direct that his licence shall remain suspended for a period of six months from today.
</p><p>Appeal partly allowed
