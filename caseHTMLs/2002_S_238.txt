</b><p>
</p><p>Arbitration Petition No. 4 of 2002
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  In view of a factual error in the order made by me on 1-5-2002, I recall the same and make the following order after hearing the parties:
</p><p>"I have been nominated by the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India to appoint a presiding arbitrator to decide the dispute between Viatra A.G. and State Trading Corporation of India Ltd."
</p><p>2.  Exercising the authority so vested in me and after hearing the parties concerned, I appoint Mr. Justice S. Ranganathan, resident of A-102, Anandlok Coop. Group Housing Society, "Purvasha", Mayur Vihar, Phase I, Delhi 110 091, a retired Judge of the Supreme Court of India as the presiding arbitrator to decide the said dispute between the parties.
</p><p>3.  The said presiding arbitrator will be paid such fee as may be determined by him.
</p><p>4.  Learned counsel appearing for the State Trading Corporation has put forward a contention that there is no valid arbitral clause in the agreement. This is not a matter for me to decide. The objection, if any, in this regard will have to be raised before the learned arbitrators.
</p><p>Ordered accordingly.
