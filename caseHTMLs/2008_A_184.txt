Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that although the High Court may be correct in taking the view that the counsel for the appellant has not been appearing on several dates, interest of justice will be subserved if the impugned judgment is set aside and the matter is directed to be heard afresh on merit by the High Court. We direct accordingly.
