</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>2 April 1996
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No. 6976 of 1996
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1. Leave granted.
</p><p>2. There is no dispute that the appellant retired on 30-6-1972. A communication was issued by the Railway Board saying that those who have retired between 1-4-1969 and 14-7-1972 could apply for pensionary benefits. There is no dispute that the appellant retired during the period aforesaid. The only difficulty is that he did not exercise the option within the time prescribed. Taking a liberal view of the matter, we direct that the same scheme be implemented in respect of the appellant from the date of filing of the application before the Tribunal.
</p><p>3. We are informed that the application had been filed in the year 1993. No arrears of pension shall be paid to the appellant. It was stated that the appellant is aged about 79 years, as such appropriate order be issued within six weeks. The appeal is accordingly disposed of. No costs.
