<div><h3>Commissioner of Central Excise, Vadodara v Marigold Paints Private Limited
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>10 March 2005
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No 5948 of 1999 With C.A No 1999.
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  Civil Appeal No. 5948 of 1999 is against the Judgment dated 11th November, 1998 and Civil Appeal No. 4934 of 1999 is against the Judgment dated 15th April, 1999 passed by the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal (CEGAT).
</p><p>2.  The question is whether the value of secondary packing i.e., card board box, used to pack Paint tins, is to be included in the assessable value of the goods, namely, paints. In our view, this case is fully covered by the principles laid down in the cases of Geep Industrial Syndicate Ltd. v. Union of India reported in <a href="/case/1986 Indlaw SC 3">1986 Indlaw SC 3</a> and C.CE. v. Ponds India Ltd. reported in <a href="/case/1989 Indlaw SC 272">1989 Indlaw SC 272</a>.
</p><p>3. In this view of the matter we see no reason to interfere with the impugned Orders.
</p><p>4.  We may also mention that the Appellants have in their list of dates referred to Civil Appeal D. No. 516 of 2000 which according to them is an identical matter. That matter has also been dismissed on 16th March, 2000 of course by a non-speaking Order.
</p><p>5.  It was sought to be submitted that the question of deducibility of trade discount also arises. No such point has been taken in the Civil Appeals. We have there fore not allowed that point to be taken at this stage and in these Appeals.
</p><p>6.  The Appeals therefore stand dismissed. These Will be no order as to Costs.
</p><p>Appeals dismissed.
