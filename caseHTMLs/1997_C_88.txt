<div><h3>Collector Of Customs, Bombay v Bina Corporation
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>3 April 1997
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No. 1596 of 1990 with C.A. Nos. 5244-5246 of 1990, Dt. 3 April 1997
</p><p>The Order of the Court is as follows:
</p><p>1.  On behalf of the respondent our attention was drawn to orders passed by this Court in appeals in the case ofCollector of Customs, Bombay v.Bina Corporation Ltd.,C. A. Nos. 1746-52 of 1988, dated September 20, 1995.
</p><p>2. It was contended that the controversy in this case stands concluded by this judgment. On behalf of the appellant this argument has been controverted by saying that these judgments specifically left out of consideration Explanation- III which was introduced to Tariff Item 15A(1) with effect from 1-3-1982 because the period involved in that case was the period between 18-7-1981 and 18-1-1982. The contention is that once this Explanation comes into operation, the conclusion in law will be different.
</p><p>3. It has been contended on behalf of the respondent that the Explanation has not really made any difference to the decision in law and the test is whether the Scraps were mouldable. Having regard to the nature of this Scrap, it cannot be said that the Explanation has made any difference at all to the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid judgment inBina Corporation'scase.
</p><p>4. It appears that this Explanation was not noticed by the Tribunal, although in the order under appeal the Appellate Collector specifically referred to and relied upon this Explanation. Under these circumstances, we are of the view the case has to be considered by the Tribunal afresh in the light of the Explanation-III to Entry 15A(1) of the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1982.
</p><p>5. We set aside the order of the Tribunal and remand the case back to the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal to pass a fresh order in accordance with the law after taking into consideration the said Explanation-III to Tariff Item 15A(2).5.
</p><p>The appeals are disposed of as above. There will be no order as to costs.
</p><p>Order accordingly.
