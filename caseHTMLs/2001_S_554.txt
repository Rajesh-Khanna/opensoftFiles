</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.12577/2000
</p><p>The order of the court was as follows:
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>1.  We have heard learned counsel and seen the order of the learned Single Judge in the writ petition and the order under challenge which summarily dismissed the appeal therefrom.
</p><p>2. The contents of the report of the Circle Inspector referred to in the order of the learned Single Judge have also been pointed out. We are of the view that the appeal deserves consideration on merits.
</p><p>3.  We do not say more because we do not wish to prejudice the case on either side.
</p><p>4.  Accordingly, the civil appeal is allowed, the order under appeal is set aside and the Appeal (L.P.A.No.1209/1999) is restored to the file of the High Court at Patna to be heard and disposed of on merits.
</p><p>No order as to costs.
</p><p>Appeal allowed.
