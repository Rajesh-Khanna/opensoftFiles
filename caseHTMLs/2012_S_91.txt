<div><h3>Surya Pal Singh v Siddha Vinayak Motors and another
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>21 February 2012
</b><p>The Judgment was delivered by :<i> Dr. B. S. Chauhan, J. and Jagdish Singh Khehar, J.
</i></p><p>
</p><p>Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No. 5302 of 2012
</p><p>1. This petition has been preferred against the judgment and order dated 19.10.2011 of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. Prima facie it appears that the three courts below erred in not considering the facts of the case in correct perspective. Under the Hire Purchase Agreement, it is the financier who is the owner of the vehicle and the person who takes the loan retain the vehicle only as a bailee/trustee; therefore, taking possession of the vehicle on the ground of non-payment of installment has already been upheld to be a legal right of the financier. This Court vide its judgment in Trilok Singh and others v. Satya Deo Tripathi, AIR 1979 SC 850 <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1979 Indlaw SC 5">1979 Indlaw SC 5</a>32"><a href="/case/1979 Indlaw SC 5">1979 Indlaw SC 5</a>32</a>, has categorically held that under the Hire Purchase Agreement, the financier is the real owner of the vehicle, therefore, there cannot be any allegation against him for having the possession of the vehicle.
</p><p>This view was again reiterated in K. A. Mathai alias Babu and another v. Kora Bibbikutty and another, 1996 (7) SCC 212 <a href="/case/1995 Indlaw SC 1">1995 Indlaw SC 1</a>540; Jagdish Chandra Nijhawaa v. S. K. Saraf, 1999 (1) SCC 119 <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1998 Indlaw SC 13">1998 Indlaw SC 13</a>19"><a href="/case/1998 Indlaw SC 13">1998 Indlaw SC 13</a>19</a> and Charanjit Singh Chadha and others v. Sudhir Mehra, 2001 (7) SCC 417 <a href="/case/2001 Indlaw SC 2">2001 Indlaw SC 2</a>1174, following the earlier judgment of this Court in Sundaram Finance Ltd. v. State of Kerala and another, AIR 1966 SC 1178 <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1965 Indlaw SC 7">1965 Indlaw SC 7</a>5"><a href="/case/1965 Indlaw SC 7">1965 Indlaw SC 7</a>5</a>; Smt. Lalmuni Devi v. State of Bihar and others, 2001 (2) SCC 17 <a href="/case/<a href="/case/2000 Indlaw SC 2">2000 Indlaw SC 2</a>61"><a href="/case/2000 Indlaw SC 2">2000 Indlaw SC 2</a>61</a>8 and Balwinder Singh v. Asstt. Commissioner, C.C.E., 2005 (4) SCC 146 <a href="/case/<a href="/case/<a href="/case/2005 Indlaw SC 2">2005 Indlaw SC 2</a>1"><a href="/case/2005 Indlaw SC 2">2005 Indlaw SC 2</a>1</a>2"><a href="/case/<a href="/case/2005 Indlaw SC 2">2005 Indlaw SC 2</a>1"><a href="/case/2005 Indlaw SC 2">2005 Indlaw SC 2</a>1</a>2</a>.
</p><p>2. In view of the above, prima facie we are of the view that the courts below has committed an error in granting compensation to the present petitioner and which appears to be non-sustainable in law.
</p><p>3. In view of the above, issue notice to the petitioner as well as to the respondents why the judgments and order impugned be not set aside. The petitioner is restrained to make any recovery from the respondent of the amount which has been awarded to him by the courts below.
</p><p>Order accordingly
