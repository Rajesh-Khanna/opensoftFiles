<div><h3>Ved Prakash Arya @ Ramjee and another v Panna Lal and others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>22 March 2017
</b><p>The Judgment was delivered by :<i> Kurian Joseph, J.
</i></p><p>
</p><p>Civil Appeal No. 6908 of 2008
</p><p>(Non-Reportable)
</p><p>1. The appellants, who are the tenants under the respondents, unsuccessful before the High Court, have filed this appeal.
</p><p>2. On 12.03.2004, notice was issued on the following terms :-
</p><p>"Issue notice to the respondents to show cause as to why all the proceedings be not set aside in view of the Uttar Pradesh Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent & Eviction) Act No. 13 of 1972 being not applicable to trust property.
</p><p>Issue notice on interim relief.
</p><p>The possession of the petitioners over the suit property shall remain protected until further orders."
</p><p>3. Having extensively heard the learned counsel for the parties, we do not find that in the peculiar facts of this case, the above question needs to be gone into.
</p><p>4. Faced with such a situation, the learned counsel for the appellants sought some time to vacate the premises. The civil appeal is, hence, dismissed, however, subject to the following :-
</p><p>(i) The appellants are granted time upto 30.06.2018 to surrender vacant and peaceful possession of the premises in question to the respondents.
</p><p>(ii) The appellants shall file a usual undertaking before this Court within four weeks from today.
</p><p>(iii) Towards use and occupation charges, the appellants shall continue to remit the amount that is being remitted now.
</p><p>It is made clear that in case the undertaking is violated, apart from any other steps, the appellants shall be liable for proceedings for contempt before this Court.
</p><p>Order accordingly
