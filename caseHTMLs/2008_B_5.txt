</p><p>C.A. No. 5320 of 2008 (Arising out of S.L.P.(C) No. 4055/04)
</p><p>Delay condoned.
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>1.  Having heard learned counsel for the respective parties, it appears to us that the law as has been explained by this Court with regard to the regularization of services of daily wagers with effect from their substantive appointments in the cadre has been lost sight of by the High Court while dealing with the matter.
</p><p>2. We are, therefore, unable to sustain the order passed by the High Court in Writ Appeal 1199/1999 and the same is set aside.
</p><p>3.  The appeal is allowed. There will be no order as to costs.
</p><p>Appeal allowed
