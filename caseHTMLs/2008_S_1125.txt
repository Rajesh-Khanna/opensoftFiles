</b><p>
</p><p>Civil Appeal No. 5656 Of 2008 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 15866 of 2007)
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows :
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>Heard learned counsel for the parties.
</p><p>1.  The High Court of Punjab and Haryana, having recorded a finding that it had no territorial jurisdiction, was not justified in making any observation in relation to the merit of the matter. Accordingly, the impugned order is set aside and the writ petition filed by the respondent before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana is dismissed on the ground of lack of territorial jurisdiction.
</p><p>2. We may, however, observe that this order shall not preclude the respondent from moving the appropriate High Court for redressal of his grievances.
</p><p>The civil appeal is, accordingly, disposed of.
</p><p>Appeal disposed of
