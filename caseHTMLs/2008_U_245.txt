<div><h3>Uptron Powertronics Limited v Ruttonsha International Rectifier Limited
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>28 January 2008
</b><p>
</p><p>Appeal (civil) 761 of 2008 (Arising out of SLP(C) No.6778/06)
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows :
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>1.  This appeal is directed against the Judgment and Order dated 29th March,2006, passed by the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Special Appeal No. 282 of 2006, wherein, upon holding that there did not seem to be any chance of revival of the appellant \026 company a direction was given that the Official Liquidator should take immediate possession and the process of winding up of the Company should be commenced. On the earlier occasion, it had been submitted on behalf of the appellant that on a reference to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction a scheme for reviving the Company, had, in fact, been taken up for approval.
</p><p>2.  It, however, appears that the said Board asked for a revised scheme to be submitted by the Operating Agency and consequent to such directions, such a revised Scheme was filed and is awaiting sanction of the Board in terms of sub-Section-(4) of Section-18 of the <a href="/acts/Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985">Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985</a>.
</p><p>3.  Having regard to the above, and also having regard to the provisions of Section 22 of the aforesaid Act, the Judgment and Order of the High Court under appeal cannot be sustained and is, accordingly, set aside.
</p><p>4.  However, the Board is directed to take up the matter for approval of the Scheme expeditiously and it will be open to the respondent to apply to the Board for consideration of its claims in the proposed Scheme.
</p><p>5.  The Appeal is disposed of with the aforesaid observations and directions. There will be no order as to costs.
</p><p>Appeal disposed of
