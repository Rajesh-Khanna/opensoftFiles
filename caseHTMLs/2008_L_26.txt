Mr. Shekhar Naphade, learned senior counsel appearing on  behalf of State of Maharashtra, on the other hand, submitted that an  officer in-charge of the police station is not obliged under law, upon   receipt of information disclosing cognizable offence, to register a case but a discretion lies with him/her in appropriate cases to hold some sort of preliminary enquiry in relation to the veracity or otherwise of the accusations made in the report.  In support of his submission, learned counsel placed reliance upon two-Judge Bench decisions of this Court in P. Sirajuddin Etc. vs. State of Madras Etc. <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1970 Indlaw SC 33">1970 Indlaw SC 33</a>9"><a href="/case/1970 Indlaw SC 33">1970 Indlaw SC 33</a>9</a>, Sevi and Anr. vs. State of Tamil Nadu and Anr. <a href="/case/1981 Indlaw SC 36">1981 Indlaw SC 36</a>, Shashikant vs. Central Bureau of Investigation and Ors. <a href="/case/2006 Indlaw SC 1">2006 Indlaw SC 1</a>447 and Rajinder Singh Katoch vs. Chandigarh Administration and Ors. <a href="/case/<a href="/case/2007 Indlaw SC 1">2007 Indlaw SC 1</a>3"><a href="/case/2007 Indlaw SC 1">2007 Indlaw SC 1</a>3</a>08, apart from certain observations made in a three-Judge Bench decision of this Court in State of Uttar Pradesh vs. Bhagwant Kishore Joshi <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1963 Indlaw SC 2">1963 Indlaw SC 2</a>68"><a href="/case/1963 Indlaw SC 2">1963 Indlaw SC 2</a>68</a>.
</p><p>4.  In view of the conflicting decisions of this Court, referred to above, we feel that it is necessary to refer the matter to a larger Bench.
</p><p>5.  Let this petition be placed before Hon'ble Chief Justice of India for passing appropriate orders to list the case before a larger Bench.
</p><p>6.  In view of the interim order passed by this Court, we feel that it would be expedient to hear this petition at an early date.
</p><p>Order accordingly.
