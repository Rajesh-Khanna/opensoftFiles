</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.5169/2000
</p><p>The Order of the court was as follows:
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>1.  We have heard learned counsel. We have perused the order under appeal and the order of the learned Single Judge which was the subject of the appeal. We are of the view that the appeal deserves to be heard and disposed of on merits. We refrain from saying any more because we do not desire to affect the case on either side adversely.
</p><p>2. The civil appeal is allowed. The order dismissing the appeal in limine is set aside. The appeal (D.B. Special Civil Appeal No.22 of 1999) is restored to the file of the High Court of Rajasthan to be heard and disposed of on merits. No order as to costs.
</p><p>Appeals disposed of.
