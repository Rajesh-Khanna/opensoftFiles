</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:

The only question in this appeal is whether the respondents were entitled to invoke Rule 2044 of the Railway Establishment Code to make deduction, for the period during which he was under suspension, from the wages which became due to the appellant consequent on the order of dismissal being set aside by the civil court.

</p><p>2.   The order of the appellate authority and the High Court are set aside and the order passed by the Payment of Wages Authority is restored. The appellant is entitled to his costs.
