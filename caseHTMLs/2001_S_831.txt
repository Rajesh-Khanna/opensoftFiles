</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>16 July 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 1371/2001
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>1.  The appellant was convicted by the Magistrate under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, and was sentenced to imprisonment for one year, and fine of Rs.2,30,000/-. On appeal, the conviction was upheld. The matter was carried in revision to the High Court. The High Court by the impugned order maintained the conviction as well as the substantive sentence, but reduced the fine. It is against this order the present appeal is directed. A limited notice had been issued on the question of sentence only. It is stated that, in the meantime, the entire amount has already been paid, which is accepted by the counsel appearing for the respondent.
</p><p>2. In view of these subsequent events, and since the appellant has already undergone sentence to the tune of about 3 weeks, we modify the sentence and direct that the period already undergone would meet the ends of justice.
</p><p>The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
</p><p>Appeal disposed of.
