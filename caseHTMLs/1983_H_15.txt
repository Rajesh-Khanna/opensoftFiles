<div><h3>Hasan Ali v State of Madhya Pradesh
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>2 February 1983
</b><p>
</p><p>Cr.A. No. 521 of 1976
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1. The appellant has been convicted u/s. 467 of the Penal Code. He was also charged u/s. 420 read with Section 120-B, I.P.C. but he was acquitted of that charge. The charge against the appellant of which he was convicted runs thus :
</p><p>"You on or about any date after 20th day of December 1968, forged a certain document purporting to be a valuable security to wit Nikah-form in respect of your marriage with Sirinbai with intent to commit fraud or that fraud may be committed and you thereby committed an offence punishable u/s. 467 of Indian Penal Code and within the cognizance of Court of Sessions."
</p><p>2. The main allegation is that the appellant forged a Nikah form. The charge does not mention under what circumstances the document was forged. It is vague. Even when the oral evidence was adduced at the trial no evidence was produced to prove the charge.
</p><p>In the circumstances we find no legal evidence on the basis of which he could be convicted. For these reasons, the appeal is allowed and the conviction and sentence of the appellant under Section 467, I.P.C. are set aside and he is acquitted of the charge. His bail bonds are cancelled. The appeal is accordingly allowed.
</p><p>Appeal allowed.
