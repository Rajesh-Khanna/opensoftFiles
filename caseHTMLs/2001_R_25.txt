<div><h3>Kanraj C. Shah v R. Thankaraj and Anr
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>23 April 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.11114/2000
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>Heard counsel for the parties.
</p><p>1. The appellant herein filed a suit for declaration and injunction. Subsequently, the defendant-respondents moved an application for amendment of written statement filed by them. The said amendment application was allowed. In view of the said amendment, the plaintiff-appellant also moved an application for amendment of the plaint by incorporating therein that the unregistered sale deed is invalid. The said application was rejected by the trial court. A revision against the said order filed before the High Court was dismissed.
</p><p>2.  However, the High Court permitted the plaintiff-appellant to lead evidence on the question of invalidity of the unregistered sale deed.
</p><p>3.  After we heard the matter, we find that, in view of the facts and circumstances of the case, the court was not justified in refusing to permit the plaintiff-appellant to amend the plaint. We, therefore, set aside the order under challenge and permit the plaintiff-appellant to amend the plaint. Accordingly, the application for amendment is allowed. However, it would be open to the defendant-respondents to raise any contention borne out from the written statement before the trial Court.
</p><p>The appeal is allowed. No costs.
</p><p>Appeal Allowed.
