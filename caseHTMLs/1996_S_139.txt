</p><p>4.  We heard counsel. In rejecting the applications under Section 256(2) of the Income-tax Act, the High Court has not even adverted to the minimal facts, and the findings of the Appellate Tribunal and has failed to give the reasons as to why the applications are rejected. Various orders appealed against are far from satisfactory. We have perused the orders passed by the Appellate
</p><p>5. Tribunal in the appeals. We are of the view that on the basis of the findings entered by the Appellate Tribunal and the decisions adverted to by it, the question of law posed in the various cases do arise out of the order of the Appellate Tribunal. It appears from the orders of the Appellate Tribunal that in disposing of the appeals and entering appropriate findings, discussion of alternate views was called for.
</p><p>6.  In the facts and circumstances, we set aside the orders passed by the High Court rejecting the applications of the revenue filed under Section 256(2) of the Income-tax Act. We direct the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Ahmedabad to refer the questions of law in the different cases, as specified herein above, for the decision of the High Court and forward the same along with the statement of the case and the relevant documents. We expect that the Appellate Tribunal will take appropriate steps expeditiously, to enable the High Court to dispose of the matter finally. The appeals are allowed. There shall be no order as to costs.
