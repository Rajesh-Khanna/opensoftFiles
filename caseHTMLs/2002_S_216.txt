<div><h3>Varinder Kumar Babla v State Of Himachal Pradesh
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>3 October 2002
</b><p>
</p><p>Cr.A. No. 1057 Of 2001
</p><p>The order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  In the instant case, the appellant has been convicted of an offence under Section 302 of the <a href="/acts/Indian Penal Code, 1860">Indian Penal Code, 1860</a> (for short "IPC") and sentenced to imprisonment for life. The case of the prosecution was that the deceased Ranjit Singh and the accused met at a tea-stall on 1st October, 1996 in the morning at 10.45 A.M. An altercation took place between them whereupon the accused took out a dragger and gave four blows on the chest and the right side of the back of the deceased.
</p><p>2.  As a result of the said injuries, Ranjit Singh died. In support of their case, the prosecution adduced PW-1 and PW-5 who were the two witnesses present at the time of occurrence.
</p><p>3.  Both the eye-witnesses have been believed by the trial court as well as the High Court. We do not see any reason as to why their testimony should be discarded.
</p><p>4.  We, however, find that the nature of the incident is such that even if the testimony of PW-1 and PW-5 is accepted as narrated by them, the offence made out would be under Section 304 Part I, Constitution and we, accordingly, convict the appellant under that Section and reduce the sentence from life imprisonment to eight years  imprisonment.
</p><p>The appeal is disposed of in the aforesaid terms.
</p><p>Appeal disposed of.
