</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>13 January 2004
</b><p>
</p><p>C.As. Nos. 1061-62 of 1998
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>
</p><p>1. On the question whether the suit filed by the respondent in the trial court was within limitation so far as the claim preferred in Original Suit No. 1 of 1974 (renumbered as Original Suit No. 38 of 1982) is concerned, the learned counsel for the appellant places reliance on a two-Judge Bench decision of this Court in P.K. Kutty Anuja Raja v. State of Kerala,<a href="/case/1996 Indlaw SC 3063">1996 Indlaw SC 3063</a>.
</p><p>1.  The learned counsel for the respondent has disputed the correctness of the view taken in P.K. Kutty case by placing reliance on a Constitution Bench decision in S.S. Rathore v. State of M.P.,<a href="/case/1989 Indlaw SC 1">1989 Indlaw SC 1</a>63 Prima facie, we are of the opinion that the decision in P.K. Kutty case needs consideration by a three-Judge Bench. Hence, adjourned for listing afresh.
</p><p>Order accordingly.
