</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>22 March 2007
</b><p>
</p><p>Cr.A. No. 1102 of 2000
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
</p><p>1.  The sole appellant was convicted by the trial court u/s. 304 Part II of the Penal Code and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of five years. On appeal being preferred, the High Court confirmed his conviction. Hence, this appeal by special leave.
</p><p>2.  The conviction of the appellant is based upon three dying declarations; one recorded by the police at the earliest point of time, the second by the Revenue Mandal Officer; and the third by the Magistrate. All the three dying declarations are consistent. In our view, the High Court was quite justified in upholding the conviction of the appellant; as such, no ground for interference is made out.
</p><p>The criminal appeal, accordingly, fails and the same is dismissed.
</p><p>Appeal dismissed.
