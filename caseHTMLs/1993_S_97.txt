<div><h3>Shanker Motiram Nale v Shiolalsing Gannusing Rajput
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>30 March 1993
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No. 1836 of 1986
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  This appeal is obviously incompetent. It is against an order of a Division Bench of the High Court rejecting the application for review of a judgment and decree passed by a learned Single Judge, who seems to have retired in the meantime. It is not against the basis judgment.
</p><p>2.   Order 47 Rule 7 of CPC bars an appeal against the order of the court rejecting the review.
</p><p>On this basis, we reject the appeal. No costs.
</p><p>I.A. No. 1/93 (Application for substitution)
</p><p>3.  No orders are necessary in view of the rejection of the appeal.
</p><p>Appeal dismissed.
