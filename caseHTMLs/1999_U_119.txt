</p><p>S.L.P. (C) No. 7347 of 1999
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  The special leave petition is not before us. Learned counsel wants us to pass an order on his oral application. We decline to do so. The application is rejected. Having regard to the fact that the application is made and strenuously pressed orally, the SLP shall now be placed on board in the ordinary course.
</p><p>2. Learned counsel states that the party will suffer. That does not mean that discipline can be violated in this fashion. Learned counsel insists that we "appreciate".
</p><p>3.  It is because of our appreciation of the discipline of the court that this order is passed.
</p><p>4. Learned counsel apologises. The apology is accepted but the order is not changed.
</p><p>Order accordingly.
