<div><h3>M.A. Wahid v State of Kerala and Others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>8 January 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14646-14647/2000
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>1.  The Corporation Councilors is in appeal against the impugned direction of the Kerala High Court. Being aggrieved by the inaction on the part of the State Government to take action against the defaulting authorities, the Councilors had moved the Kerala High Court. The Division Bench of the Kerala High Court considered the reports submitted by the Accountant General (Audit) and came to the conclusion that the said report submitted is an elaborate one and valuable suggestions have been given therein to be complied with by the Corporation and the State Government.
</p><p>2. In view of this observation of the Kerala High Court and since the Accountant General (Audit) has looked into and has given a detailed report, we see no justification in the prayer of the Councilors to get the matter enquired by any other investigating agency. Obviously, the Accountant General (Audit) is the most competent person to go into this matter and express opinion/views. If there has been any inaction on the part of the State Government, it is open to the Councilors to move the High Court concerned.
</p><p>The appeals are accordingly disposed of.
</p><p>Appeals disposed of.
