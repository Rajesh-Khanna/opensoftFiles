<div><h3>Speed Lines Private Limited v Commissioner of Income Tax
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>9 March 2007
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No. 1245 of 2007
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1. Leave granted.
</p><p>2. Heard Mr. Bhargava V. Desai, learned counsel for the appellant and Mr. Vikas Singh, learned ASG for the respondent.
</p><p>3. The appellant aggrieved against the order dated 23 -8-2005 passed by the High Court of Delhi in ITA No. 327 of 2005 filed the present appeal in this Court on the ground that the order passed by the High Court is non-speaking. The High Court on 23-8-2005 has passed the following order which reads thus:
</p><p>"Dated 23-8-2005
</p><p>ITA No. 327/2005
</p><p>Heard.
</p><p>No substantial question of law arises for consideration.
</p><p>Dismissed."
</p><p>4. While entertaining the Special Leave Petition, this Court issued notice to the respondent limited to the question as to why the matter should not be remanded back to the High Court. Since the order of the High Court is non-speaking, we are of the view that the order is liable to be set aside and the matter be remitted to the High Court for fresh consideration of the entire matter on merits and in accordance with law.
</p><p>5. We, therefore, allow this appeal and remit the matter to the High Court with a request to dispose of the same as expeditiously as possible. No costs.
</p><p>Appeal allowed.
