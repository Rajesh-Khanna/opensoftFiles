<div><h3>Lallu v Financial Commissioner and Others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>14 February 1989
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No. 1383 of 1986
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  Heard learned counsel for the parties. In the facts and circumstances of the case, we see no grounds to differ from the view taken by the Financial Commissioner as affirmed by the High Court that the appellant has rendered himself liable for eviction as he had failed to pay the rent regularly without sufficient cause. In Raj Kanta v. Financial Commissioner, Punjab, <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1980 Indlaw SC 6">1980 Indlaw SC 6</a>12"><a href="/case/1980 Indlaw SC 6">1980 Indlaw SC 6</a>12</a><a href="/case/<a href="/case/1980 Indlaw SC 6">1980 Indlaw SC 6</a>12"><a href="/case/1980 Indlaw SC 6">1980 Indlaw SC 6</a>12</a>,this Court has held that even a single default in payment of rent without sufficient cause would render a tenant liable for eviction.
</p><p>2.   In this case, the default in payment of rent is for the period from Kharif 1978 to Rabi 1980. The appeal is therefore dismissed. There will however be no order as to costs.
</p><p>Appeal dismissed.
