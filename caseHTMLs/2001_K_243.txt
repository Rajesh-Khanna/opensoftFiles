<div><h3>T. Balamukunda Rao (D) By L.Rs. and Others v Kumari Anandan
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>18 July 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No.9070/1996
</p><p>The order of the court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  The plaintiff-respondent brought a suit on the original side of the High Court of Madras for specific performance of an alleged oral agreement entered into between the parties some time in the end of June, 1978. The said suit was dismissed. Subsequently, the plaintiff-respondent preferred an appeal before the High Court. The High Court after taking a curious view in the matter remitted the matter to the trial Court for decision afresh. It is against the said decision, the defendant-appellant has preferred this appeal by way of special leave petition.
</p><p>2.  We have heard learned counsel for the parties. The only question that arises in the suit is whether there was an oral agreement as alleged by the plaintiff in his plaint and whether the plaintiff paid any earnest money to the defendant in pursuance of such an agreement. The question whether such an agreement is void or voidable does not arise in the case.
</p><p>3.  If it is held that there is an agreement between the parties, the question whether such an agreement is void or voidable is in the realm of legal arguments. The High Court fell in error in remanding the matter to the trial Court to decide the question whether the agreement is void or voidable which, in fact, did not arise in the suit at all.
</p><p>4. We, therefore, set aside the judgment under appeal and remit the matter to the High Court for deciding the appeal afresh in accordance with law. In view of the special facts and circumstances of the case, we request the High Court to consider the prayer of the appellants herein for expediting the hearing for the appeal.The appeal is allowed. There shall be no order as to costs.
</p><p>Appeal allowed.
