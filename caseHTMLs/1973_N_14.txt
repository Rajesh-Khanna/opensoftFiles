<div><h3>Narendra Swarup Bhatnagar v State of Rajasthan and Others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>10 December 1973
</b><p>The Judgment was delivered by :<i> M. Hameedullah Beg, J.
</i></p><p>
</p><p>Cr.A. No. 119 of 1970.
</p><p>1.  We have heard learned for both sides. We think that this is not a fit case for interference u/art. 136 of the Constitution. The High Court had quashed the commitment of the accused on the ground that the offences alleged to have been committed before the filing of the complaint, being legally unconnected with those alleged after the filing of the complaint, should be inquired into separately.
</p><p>2. The parties were left to urge other points involved in the cases. We think that this amounts to leaving all points of the law and fact, except that the cases should be tried together, open to the parties to urge in the cases which may now be inquired into.
</p><p>Consequently we dismiss this appeal by special leave.
</p><p>Appeal Dismissed.
