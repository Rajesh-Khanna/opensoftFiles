<div><h3>Arun Ahluwalia v State (Through Government of Nct, Delhi)
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>4 September 2000
</b><p>
</p><p>Cr.A. No. 758 of 2000.
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>1.  The appellant stood convicted under Sections 279/304-A <a href="/acts/Indian Penal Code, 1860">Indian Penal Code, 1860</a> for having driven the Maruti Gypsy negligently, but he was released on probation by the learned Magistrate with the direction that he will pay some compensation to the heirs of the victim. Against the said conviction, he preferred an appeal.
</p><p>2. The learned appellate court was of the view that the appeal itself was not maintainable. Against that order of the Appellate Authority, he referred a revision which was dismissed in limine.
</p><p>3.  Mr. Ranjit Kumar, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant contended that the Appellate Authority committed serious error by holding that the appeal itself is not maintainable merely because the Magistrate had released the accused on probation.
</p><p>4.  Having heard Mr. Ranjit Kumar and the learned Attorney-General for the respondent, we have no manner of doubt that the Appellate Judge committed serious error in holding the appeal to be not maintainable.
</p><p>5. We, therefore, set aside the revisional order as well as the appellate order and direct that the appeal of the accused be entertained and disposed of on merits. This criminal appeal stands disposed of accordingly.
</p><p>Appeal disposed of.
