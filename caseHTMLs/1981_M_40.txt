In all these appeals, the question raised is whether when pineapple fruit processed into pineapple slices for the purpose of being sold in sealed cans, it can be said that the original pineapple fruit is consumed for the purpose of manufacture and, therefore, the case falls under Section 5-A(1) (a) of the <a href="/acts/Kerala General Sales Tax Act, 1963">Kerala General Sales Tax Act, 1963</a>.
