</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>15 December 2000
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20084/2000
</p><p>The order of the court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  The learned single Judge of the High Court as well as division bench of the High Court rightly pointed out that when facts are so seriously disputed, such disputes cannot be resolved in a summary way as is being done under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
</p><p>2. Hence the High Court suggested the petitioner to resort to civil proceedings.
</p><p>3.  The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the corrigendum issued by the Stated Government on 30.4.1997 and published on 2.10.1997 will be put up against them in the civil suit and that the said corrigendum does not reflect the true facts. It is open to the petitioner to challenge the said corrigendum also in the civil suit. The Special Leave Petition is dismissed.
</p><p>Petition dismissed.
