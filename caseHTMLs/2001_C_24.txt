<div><h3>C.C.Kamble (Dead) By Lrs v Erravva and Others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>12 January 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.4693/2000
</p><p>The order of the court was as follows:
</p><p>Delay condoned.
</p><p>Heard.
</p><p>1.  The Appellate Authority while reversing the order of the Land Tribunal had entered upon fresh fact finding and thereby dislodged the claim of the petitioner regarding the occupancy right. The High Court did not interfere with such fact finding as per the impugned order. Learned counsel cited the decision of this Court in Mohan Balaku Patil and others vs.
</p><p>Krishnoji Bhaurao Hundre (dead) by Lrs. in support of the contentions that despite the reversal of the Appellate Authority this Court has got jurisdiction to interfere with it. But the point involved in the present appeal is different from the one involved in the cited decision.
</p><p>2. In that case the claimants were found in possession of the land on the strength the entries found in the Record of Rights. In the present case there is no such entry, on the contrary entries were to the effect that owners were in possession of the land.
</p><p>We do not find any reason to interfere.
</p><p>Accordingly, Special Leave Petitions are dismissed.
</p><p>Petitions dismissed.
