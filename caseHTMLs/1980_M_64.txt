</p><p>1.  After hearing counsel for the parties we allow C.M.P. No. 6495 of 1980 for the revocation of Special Leave Petition granted as per this Court's order dated 12th December, 1979. There are two facts which stand out.

</p><p>4.  For these two reasons we revoke the Special Leave Petition granted earlier and dismiss the appeal arising out of that S. L. P. The stay already granted automatically stands vacated.
</p><p>Order accordingly.
