<div><h3>P. S. Sharma v Madanlal Kasturichandji and another
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>13 August 2002
</b><p>
</p><p>Cr.A. No. 302 of 1996
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  This appeal is directed against an order of acquittal in proceedings arising under the <a href="/acts/Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954">Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954</a>.
</p><p>2.  On the basis that the samples of the milk taken from the respondents contained 6.6% of milk fat and 7.5% of milk solids non-fat, the proceedings were initiated. As per the report of the Public Analyst, the sample contained 3.01% milk fat and 11.02% milk solids non-fat. The difference ultimately came down to only one per cent from the standard quantity. On this aspect, the contention put forth on behalf of the respondents is that the difference in percentage is on account of the circumstance that the distribution of fat in the milk in separate sample bottles will not be even as a result of violent churning of the milk. When marginal difference like one per cent was noticed by the Public Analyst or by the Central Food Laboratory, the courts have taken the view that it is possible that there may be some error creeping in the conclusion reached thereto.
</p><p>3. In somewhat similar circumstances, this Court has upheld the orders of the courts below acquitting the accused in Administrator of the City of Nagpur v. Laxman <a href="/case/1994 Indlaw SC 2086">1994 Indlaw SC 2086</a>The view taken by the High Court of Gujarat in State v. Bhagubhai Ramjibhai 1982 Indlaw GUJ 7 followed by the High Court is also on the same lines.
</p><p>4.  Therefore, our interference in the present case is not called for. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
</p><p>Appeal dismissed.
