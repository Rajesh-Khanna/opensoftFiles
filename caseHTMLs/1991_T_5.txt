<div><h3>Appropriate Authority and Another v Tanvi Trading and Credits Private Limited
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>23 April 1991
</b><p>
</p><p>S.L.P. (C) No. 6304 of 1991.
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1. Counsel for the petitioners fairly tells us that a no-objection certificate was issued as early as on 15-1-1991. The suggestion that it was under pressure and threat of a contempt proceeding is made out from the record.
</p><p>2.    We agree that two alternatives are open under the scheme of the legislation:
</p><p>(i) the Union of India through the appropriate authority could buy the property, or
</p><p>(ii) in the event of its decision not to buy, it has to issue a "no-objection certificate" leaving it open to the parties to deal with the property. In that view of the matter, the High Court was right in its conclusion.
</p><p>The special leave petition is dismissed. No costs.
</p><p>Petition dismissed.
