</p><p>C.A. No. 5993 of 2007
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>None appears for the appellant - Commissioner of Central Excise.
</p><p>1.  With the fair assistance rendered by the learned Senior Counsel Shri Hidayatulla, appearing on behalf of assessee (respondent), we have examined the impugned judgment of the Tribunal which has succinctly brought out the distinction between Hire-Purchase Agreement and Hire-Purchase Finance.
</p><p>2. Accordingly we hold that service tax was not leviable on Hire-Purchase Finance. In this regard, we find no infirmity in the impugned judgment of the Tribunal.
</p><p>Accordingly, Civil Appeal stands dismissed with no order as to costs.
</p><p>Appeal dismissed.
