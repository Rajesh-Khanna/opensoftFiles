</p><p>The order of the court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  We permit the petitioner to challenge the order dated 7/8.8.1996 which is claimed to be one passed in compliance with the direction issued by the High Court. We make a note of the arguments of Mr.A.K.Ganguli, learned senior counsel that the said order is not in compliance with the direction but we do not think that the same can be considered in a contempt matter.
</p><p>2. Therefore, we leave it open to the petitioner to challenge the correctness or validity of the said order. Without prejudice to any such contention we close this matter.
</p><p>The SLP is disposed of accordingly.
</p><p>Petition disposed of.
