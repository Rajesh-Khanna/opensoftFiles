<div><h3>Pritpal Singh and Others v State of Punjab and Others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>3 February 1987
</b><p>
</p><p>Civil Miscellaneous Petition No. 7058 of 1986 in W.P. No. 266 of 1979
</p><p>The Order of the Court is as follow":
</p><p>1. This application for directions appears to be wholly misconceived. It purports to challenge the final seniority list of Punjab Superior Judicial Service Cadre as published by the State of Punjab in Gazette Notification dated February 27, 1982 on the ground that there is non-compliance of the directions made by this Court in B. S. Yadav v. State of Haryana <a href="/case/1980 Indlaw SC 2">1980 Indlaw SC 2</a>20<a href="/case/1980 Indlaw SC 2">1980 Indlaw SC 2</a>20.
</p><p>2. If that be so, the remedy of the petitioner is by way of a petition under Article 226 of the <a href="/acts/Constitution of India, 1950">Constitution of India, 1950</a> in the High Court and not by this application for directions.
</p><p>3. The application for directions is, therefore, dismissed. The petitioners are at liberty to move the High Court, if so advised, subject to just objections.
</p><p>Application dismissed.
