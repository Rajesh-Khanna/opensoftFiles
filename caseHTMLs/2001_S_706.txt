<div><h3>Dalbir Singh v State of Haryana and Others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>15 October 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.13573/1999
</p><p>The order of the court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  Having heard the learned counsel for the parties for a considerable time, we are of the view that interference of this Court with the order under Article 136 under challenge is not warranted.
</p><p>2. However, we make it clear that that order does not preclude the petitioner from approaching the High Court to implead himself in Writ Petition No.6167 of 1988, if it is pending. If such application is filed, the same will be heard and decided on merits. With the above observations, the Special Leave Petition is dismissed.
</p><p>Petition dismissed.
