<div><h3>Srinivasa Reddy v Kuber Singh and Others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>14 December 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.13128/2000
</p><p>The order of the court was as follows:
</p><p>Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
</p><p>Leave is granted.
</p><p>1.  This appeal is directed against the order of the High Court of Karnataka at Bangalore in CRP No.1367/2000 dated 22nd June, 2000.
</p><p>2.  The controversy in this appeal relates to amendment of the written statement. The trial court permitted the amendment of the written statement to raise counter claim by its order dated 23rd March, 2000 passed in the suit. In revision petition filed against the said order before the High Court the following order was passed:- "Heard.
</p><p>No grounds.
</p><p>3. The petition stands dismissed." In the view we have taken we do not consider it necessary to advert to the various aspects relating to the amendment of the written statement by raising a counter claim. Suffice it to say that the High Court has not considered the issues raised before it and dismissed the revision by passing the above said order.
</p><p>4. We think it appropriate to set aside the order under challenge, send the matter back to the High Court to decide the revision on merits after hearing both the parties. The appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs.
</p><p>Appeal allowed.
