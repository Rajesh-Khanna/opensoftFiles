<div><h3>Vikas Tank v Indo-Russian Alumni Educational Association
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>13 March 2002
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No. 4423 of 2001
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  This appeal arises out of an order made by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Original Petition No. 83/1996. The order made by the Commission reads as follows:
</p><p>"This is not a fit case to be tried under the <a href="/acts/Consumer Protection Act, 1986">Consumer Protection Act, 1986</a>. The original petition is dismissed."
</p><p>2.  Whatever may be reasons for dismissal of the original petition, however brief the order may be, the Commission should have adverted to the facts, likely issues arising before it and its conclusion thereafter. If these aspects are missing, it will be difficult to appreciate the order made by the Commission.
</p><p>3.  In that view of the matter, we set aside the order made by the Commission and remit the matter to the Commission for fresh disposal in accordance with law and in the light of the observations made above. The appeal is allowed accordingly.
</p><p>Appeal allowed.
