<div><h3>Ashok Kumar Sharma and Anr v Punjab State Coop.Sup. and Mkt.Fed.Ltd. and Anr
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>19 March 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.11359/2000
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>1.  The order under challenge dismisses a second appeal in limine for the reason that it was found to have no merit.
</p><p>2.  Having heard learned counsel, we are of the view that the order under challenge should be set aside and the second appeal (R.S.A. No.3335 of 1998) should be restored to the file of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana to be heard and disposed of on merits.
</p><p>3. For such hearing, every available contention shall be open to both sides. We refrain from saying any more because we do not desire to prejudice the case on either side.
</p><p>The civil appeal is allowed accordingly.
</p><p>No order as to costs.
</p><p>Appeal allowed.
