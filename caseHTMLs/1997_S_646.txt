</p><p>S.L.P. (C) No. 3551 of 1997 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 9 July 1993 of the Rajasthan High Court in D.B.C.W.P. No. 6038 of 1992), (CC No. 1349 of 1997)
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows :
</p><p>Delay condoned.
</p><p>1.  The controversy raised in this case is already coverd by a judgment of this Court reported in Shambhu Singh Meena Vs. State of Rajasthan (1995 (supp.2) SCC 431 <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1995 Indlaw SC 1">1995 Indlaw SC 1</a>031"><a href="/case/1995 Indlaw SC 1">1995 Indlaw SC 1</a>031</a> wherein this court, on consideration of rule 28-B of the Rajasthan Administrative Service Rules 1954 and its explanation as it stood prior to November 3, 1991, had interpreted and held that the rule requires that the record of the officer should be outstanding or consistently very good and that would imply that it should be so for the entire period under consideration.
</p><p>2.  The view of the High court, therefore, was upheld and held that the amendment made on 30-11-1991, being subsequent to the orders of promotions which were challenged in those cases could not apply to the cases prior to the amendment came into force. The same ratio applies to the facts in this case. Therefore, we do not find any ground warranting issuance of notice for interference.
</p><p>The Petition is accordingly dismissed.
