</p><p>1.  An order of eviction from certain plots of land passed under the U.P. Land (Eviction and Recovery of Rent and Damages) Act, 1959 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) was confirmed in appeal by the Additional District Judge, Kumaon. The appellate order was sought to be revised through an application filed in the Allahabad High Court, a learned Single Judge of which held, following a judgment of a Full Bench of that Court in Raja Ram Verma v. State of Uttar Pradesh 1968 Indlaw ALL 179, that the Act was ultra vires of the Constitution in its entirety and that, therefore, the eviction order had to be set aside.
</p><p>2. The application made by the respondent to the High Court was accepted solely on that ground. The order of the High Court is dated July 30, 1969 and it is that order which is impugned in this appeal by special leave.
</p><p>3.  Learned counsel for the parties are agreed that in view of the dictum of this Court in Maganlal Chhagganlal (P) Ltd. v. Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1974 Indlaw SC 2">1974 Indlaw SC 2</a>70"><a href="/case/1974 Indlaw SC 2">1974 Indlaw SC 2</a>70</a><a href="/case/<a href="/case/1974 Indlaw SC 2">1974 Indlaw SC 2</a>70"><a href="/case/1974 Indlaw SC 2">1974 Indlaw SC 2</a>70</a><a href="/case/<a href="/case/1974 Indlaw SC 2">1974 Indlaw SC 2</a>70"><a href="/case/1974 Indlaw SC 2">1974 Indlaw SC 2</a>70</a>, the Act cannot be deemed to suffer from any unconstitutionality.
