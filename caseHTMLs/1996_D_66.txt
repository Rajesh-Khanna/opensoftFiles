</p><p>2. It is agreed that this question is covered against the appellant by the decision of this Court in Associated Cement Company Ltd. v.

</p><p>The second question is:
</p><p>"Whether the amount of the duty of excise payable by a manufacturer mentioned in Section 280ZD for the purposes of tax credit certificate postulated by that section and Section 280ZE of the  Income Tax Act,1961,  means excise duty actually paid or excise duty leviable under the Excise Act?"
