</p><p>Review Petn. No. 5 of 1977 (Appln. for Review of Court's Judgment. D/- 16 August 1974 reported in AIR 1974 SC 2165), Dt. 2 March 1977.
</p><p>1.  Mr. Frank Anthony who appears on behalf of the petitioner wanted to challenge in this review petition both the conviction and sentenced of the petitioner but on the last occasion it was decided to issue notice to the respondent on the question of sentence only.
</p><p>2. The learned counsel has made an impassioned appeal to us for reducing the death sentence to life imprisonment but nothing that he has said can, on our opinion, justify the reduction of the sentence of death imposed on the petitioner. The sessions Court sentenced the appellant to death after a careful consideration of the matter and so did the High Court. While upholding that sentence we gave our reason to show how the sentence was justified and why no interference therewith was called for. Here has to be some end to litigation and howsoever severe the consequences of the judgments of three Courts may be, we are left in no doubt that despite the somewhat long passage of time since the Sessions Court delivered its judgment, there is no reason whatsoever for reviewing the sentence of death imposed on the petitioner and for reducing it to a lesser sentence. The decisions cited by Mr. Anthony do not bear on the question which is relevant for the purposes of this review petition.
</p><p>The petition is accordingly dismissed.
</p><p>Review dismissed.
