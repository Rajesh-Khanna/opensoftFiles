<div><h3>Ashok Kumar Singh Chandel v State of Uttar Pradesh
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>17 September 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 3285/2001
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Heard learned counsel for the petitioner.
</p><p>1.  The impugned order passed by the High Court does not call for any interference. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that merely because the petitioner is an M.P., the High Court ought not to have drawn any adverse inference.
</p><p>2.  For grant or refusal of bail, seriousness of the offence on the basis of the material collected by the investigating Agency is required to be taken into consideration. In the present case, murder of five persons is alleged to have been committed and petitioners along with other persons is chargesheeted for the offences punishable under Sections 147, 148, 149, 307, 302 and 395/396 IPC. It is true that in criminal matters social status of the accused is not required to be considered for deciding the matter.
</p><p>3.   In our view, the High Court has not held that as petitioner is a Member of Parliament, the bail is refused or has not drawn any adverse inference. Further, the High Court has passed appropriate orders.
</p><p>4.  In this view of the matter, the impugned order passed by the High Court refusing to grant bail does not call for any interference. Hence, this petition is dismissed.
</p><p>Petition dismissed.
