</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Cr.).../2001
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Delay condoned.
</p><p>1.  Mr. R. Venkataramani, learned senior counsel submitted that the petitioner is not now pressing the relief for investigation of the case based on his allegation to be conducted by the CBI. Presently he is interested only in the relief prayed for in the writ petition for quashment of STC No.628/1994. We are told that the said case has been charge-sheeted before the trial court. It is open to the petitioner to raise the contention before the trial court for pre-trial discharge if he is entitled to it. Learned senior counsel submitted that the observations of the impugned judgment made by the High Court may stand in the way.
</p><p>2. We make it clear that if any plea is made for pre-trial discharge the same shall be considered and disposed of untramelled by any of the observations made in the impugned judgment.
</p><p>With these observations the SLP is dismissed.
</p><p>Petition dismissed.
