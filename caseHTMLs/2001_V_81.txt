<div><h3>Vijay Kumar v Radhey Shyam and Others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>17 August 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Cr.).../2001
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Delay condoned.
</p><p>1.  Learned counsel submits that it was a police charge sheet case and the accused filed the revision before the Sessions court without impleading the complainant at whose instance the investigation was commenced. Even so, we do not think that it is necessary to grant special leave in this matter particularly because he gets a chance for addressing arguments before the Sessions court now and the revision can be disposed of by the Sessions Judge afresh.
</p><p>2.  We, therefore, dismiss this Special Leave Petition keeping the question of law undecided.
</p><p>Petiton Dismissed.
