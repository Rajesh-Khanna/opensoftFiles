</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>24 February 1999
</b><p>
</p><p>S.L.P. (C) No. 2407 of 1999
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  Learned counsel for the petitioner states that there are three options under the law for punishing a man who has violated the law as here. He also submits that the punishment is harsh because the petitioner is 71 years old. He submits that a token punishment should be awarded.
</p><p>2.  Firstly, 20 years have elapsed before the petitioner took steps in appeal and although there was no stay he did not comply with the order.
</p><p>3. Secondly, if he is in breach he must be punished regardless of his age. Thirdly, there is no reason why we should exercise our discretion in favour of such a man to impose anything less than the punishment which has been imposed.
</p><p>The SLP is dismissed.
</p><p>Petition dismissed.
