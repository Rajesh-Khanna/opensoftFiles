<div><h3>Masoodul Hasan v Syed Irfan Ahmad and Others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>31 August 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 1519/2001
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  Learned counsel for respondent No. 2 and respondent No. 1 appearing in person submitted that a series of cases were together heard by the High Court and they were all disposed of on the same day after reaching an understanding between the parties. We perused the two other orders passed by the High Court on the same day between the same parties.
</p><p>2.  After reading them we are inclined to think that the impugned order was also dealt with as a part of that series. As the High Court has adopted such a stand on the submissions made before the learned Judge himself, we do not think that this is a fit case to grant special leave to appeal.
</p><p>Accordingly, the Special Leave Petition is dismissed.
</p><p>Petition dismissed.
