<div><h3>Republican Party of India (Athawale) v Union of India and Others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>16 March 2000
</b><p>
</p><p>W.P. (C) No. 94 of 2000
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  The petitioner relies upon Article 368 of the Constitution of India while seeking to challenge the resolution of the Government which has set up a Commission to review the Constitution and to make suitable recommendations for any possible changes. Article 368 does not come into play at this juncture. The resolution dated 22-2-2000 is only an administrative decision of the Government asking for recommendations on the basis of which further action may or may not be taken. In our opinion, the provisions of Article 77 on which reliance is placed, also does not come into the picture.
</p><p>This writ petition is dismissed with these observations.
</p><p>Petition dismissed.
