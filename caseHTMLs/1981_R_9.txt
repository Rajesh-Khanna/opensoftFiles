</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>14 August 1981
</b><p>
</p><p>Cr.A. No. 643 of 1981
</p><p>The Order of the Court is as follows:
</p><p>Heard counsel. Special leave granted.
</p><p>1.  The circumstances of the case are very sad and touching. A desolate woman jumped into a well with her two children. She was charged u/ss. 307 and 309 of the Penal Code. She has been released on admonition for the offence u/s. 309 of the Penal Code and has been sentenced to imprisonment for three months for the offence under S. 307.
</p><p>We see no valid reason for making this distinction and therefore direct that she shall be released on admonition for the offence under S. 307 also. She need not surrender to her bail.
</p><p>Order accordingly.
