Accordingly, the proper basis of fixing compensation in these cases being fifteen years' purchase, the compensation awarded for lands in these cases should be reduced by one-fourth.The claimants shall get solatium of 15 per cent on the compensation computed on the above basis on the aggregate amount from the date of taking possession of the land till the date of payment.
</p><p>4. The result, therefore, is that the appeals must succeed and are allowed. The judgment and decrees of the courts below shall stand modified accordingly. Costs shall be borne by the parties as incurred.
