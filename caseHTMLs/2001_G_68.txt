</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.6235/2001
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>We are not inclined to interfere with the matter.
</p><p>1.  The Special Leave Petition is dismissed. After we dismissed the matter, learned counsel for the petitioners stated that in case the petitioners are required to vacate the premises immediately, it shall create great hardship to them. Therefore, some time may be granted to vacate the premises. We feel that the request is justified.
</p><p>2. We, therefore, grant time till 31.12.2001 to the petitioners to vacate the premises on their filing usual undertaking in this Court within four weeks from today. In the event, the undertaking is not filed, this order shall stand vacated without reference to the Court.
</p><p>Petition dismissed.
