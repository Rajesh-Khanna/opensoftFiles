</p><p>5.

</p><p>6. The trial court shall then issue notice to the appellant and fix a date for filing written statement and thereafter proceed in accordance with law.
</p><p>7.  The amount already deposited by the appellant will be permitted to be withdrawn by the respondent Bank and will be adjusted towards the suit amount. The further amount to be deposited, in case it is deposited, shall also be permitted to be withdrawn by the respondent Bank and adjusted towards the suit amount.
</p><p>8.
