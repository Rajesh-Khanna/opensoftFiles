<div><h3>Milk Specialities Limited v Rajiv Singh
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>4 February 2005
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No. 905 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 18336 of 2003)
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>Heard parties.
</p><p>1.  In this matter, the State Commission refused to condone a delay of 57 days and dismissed the appeal. This was also confirmed by the National Commission. In our view a small delay like this should have been condoned.
</p><p>2. We, therefore, set aside the orders of the National Commission and the State Commission and restore Appeal No.351 of 2001 to the file of the State Commission, Uttaranchal, Dehradun. The State Commission shall dispose of the appeal on its merits as expeditiously as possible and within a period of three months in any case.
</p><p>3.  The appeal is accordingly disposed of. There shall be no order as to costs.
</p><p>Appeal disposed of.
