</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:

</p><p>2.  We are of the view that, on a plain interpretation of Section 4 of the <a href="/acts/Kerala Joint Hindu Family System (Abolition) Act, 1975">Kerala Joint Hindu Family System (Abolition) Act, 1975</a>, no other view can be taken. All that this section envisages is an imaginary partition and holding by those entitled to shares on such partition of such shares as full owners thereof. Those who are not co-parceners do not get any shares as a result of this section.
</p><p>The civil appeals are dismissed. No order as to costs.
