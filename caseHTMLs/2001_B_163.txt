<div><h3>Bharat Chemicals Industries v State of Uttar Pradesh and others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>18 July 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No. 703 of 1981
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  In this appeal by special leave the core issue is a sequel to the decision of a seven-Judge Constitution Bench in Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. v. State of U.P. <a href="/case/1989 Indlaw SC 286">1989 Indlaw SC 286</a> Subsequently, it appears that contrary views were expressed by different Benches of this Court as to whether money, which had not been recovered in respect of the period prior to 25-10-1989 could be recovered thereafter.
</p><p>2. The matter has now been set at rest by a Constitution Bench in Somaiya Organics (India) Ltd. v. State of U.P. <a href="/case/<a href="/case/2001 Indlaw SC 4">2001 Indlaw SC 4</a>62"><a href="/case/2001 Indlaw SC 4">2001 Indlaw SC 4</a>62</a> Learned counsel for the parties are agreed that the reasoning of the judgment and the conclusions arrived at therein by the Constitution Bench apply to this case.
</p><p>3.  Therefore, we allow this appeal in terms of the judgment in Somaiya Organics case <a href="/case/<a href="/case/2001 Indlaw SC 4">2001 Indlaw SC 4</a>62"><a href="/case/2001 Indlaw SC 4">2001 Indlaw SC 4</a>62</a> (supra). The reasoning and conclusions of that judgment shall apply to this case.
</p><p>4.  As a consequence, the bank guarantee shall stand discharged and the appellant shall have the liberty to proceed in accordance with law. No costs.
</p><p>Appeal allowed.
