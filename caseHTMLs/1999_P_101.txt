<div><h3>State of Gujarat and Another v Pwd Employees Union and Others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>9 September 1999
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No. 8577 of 1994
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  Having heard learned Senior Counsel Shri. Dholakia for the appellant State, we do not think that this is a fit case for our interference.
</p><p>2.  The sole question is whether PWD is an industry and therefore governed under the <a href="/acts/Industrial Disputes Act, 1947">Industrial Disputes Act, 1947</a>.
</p><p>3. This question is squarely covered by a decision of the Constitution Bench in the case of Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board v. A. Rajappa <a href="/case/1978 Indlaw SC 2">1978 Indlaw SC 2</a>60<a href="/case/1978 Indlaw SC 2">1978 Indlaw SC 2</a>60<a href="/case/1978 Indlaw SC 2">1978 Indlaw SC 2</a>60.
</p><p>4.  It is true that earlier a Bench of two learned Judges wanted this decision to be reconsidered but that reference has been sent back by a larger Bench of this Court and the decision in the case of Bangalore Water Supply <a href="/case/1978 Indlaw SC 2">1978 Indlaw SC 2</a>60<a href="/case/1978 Indlaw SC 2">1978 Indlaw SC 2</a>60.
</p><p>No costs.
</p><p>Order accordingly.
