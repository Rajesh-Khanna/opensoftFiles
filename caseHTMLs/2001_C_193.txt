</p><p>2. Learned counsel for the appellant, however, brings to our notice an order of this Court reported in <a href="/case/1999 Indlaw SC 7">1999 Indlaw SC 7</a>99<a href="/case/1999 Indlaw SC 7">1999 Indlaw SC 7</a>99 Collector of Central Excise, Vadodara v. Dhiren Chemical Industries - Civil Appeal No. 7937/1995 in which it is observed that there appears to be a conflict between the decisions of this Court in Usha Martin Industries (supra) and Motiram Tolaram and Another v. Union of India and Another <a href="/case/1999 Indlaw SC 5">1999 Indlaw SC 5</a>26<a href="/case/1999 Indlaw SC 5">1999 Indlaw SC 5</a>26.
</p><p>3.  As we see it, there does not appear to be any conflict and in Motiram Tolaram's case (supra) the decision in Usha Martin Industries' case (supra) was explained and distinguished in the judgment. However, in view of the fact that in Dhiren Chemical Industries' case (Civil Appeal No. 7937/1995), a Bench of this Court has directed the matter to be referred to a Constitution Bench, we direct that these appeals be also listed for hearing along with Dhiren Chemical Industries' case.
