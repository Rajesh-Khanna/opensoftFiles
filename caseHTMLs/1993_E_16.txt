<div><h3>Employees' State Insurance Corporation v Premier Clay Products
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>25 August 1993
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No. 3218 of 1989
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  There is no substance in this appeal filed by the Corporation. The respondent had hired some casual coolies for loading and unloading of its goods. The work itself was of a sporadic nature. The coolies were available for work to others and in fact on the very day worked for several others who engaged them.
</p><p>2.   In the circumstances, the said coolies cannot even be called casual workmen. Hence no contribution is payable by the respondent to the Corporation on their behalf. The case of the appellant-Corporation was, therefore, rightly negatived by the courts below.
</p><p>The appeal is dismissed with no order as to costs.
</p><p>Appeal dismissed.
