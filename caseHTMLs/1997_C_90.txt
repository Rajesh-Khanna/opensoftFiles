<div><h3>Silbans International v Collector Of Customs
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>24 July 1997
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No. 1216 of 1993, Dt. 24 July 1997
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  We have heard learned counsel for the parties. We have also perused impugned order passed by the High Court. In our opinion the High Court has rightly held that the writ petition filed by the appellant seeking the relief in respect of grant of detention certificate was not maintainable in the facts and circumstances of this case especially when the appellant has already cleared the goods from the warehouse by paying the demurrage charges.
</p><p>2. The High Court was also right in taking the view that appellant may seek other remedy available under law. We do not find any infirmity in the impugned judgment of the High Court.
</p><p>The appeal is, therefore, dismissed. No costs.
</p><p>Appeal dismissed.
