<div><h3>Messrs Sharaddha Associates v St.Patrick's Town Coop.Hsng.Soc.Ltd. and Others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>6 November 2000
</b><p>
</p><p>I.A. No.3 In C.A..No.1911/1999
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  The High Court took the view that the Cooperative Court had no jurisdiction to adjudicate the issue in view of Section 91 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act.
</p><p>2.  This view was taken both by the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench. It is that finding which has been put in issue in this appeal. We consider it appropriate to direct that the appeal itself be placed for hearing on a "non-miscellaneous day" after three weeks before the appropriate Bench rather than to take up these applications at this stage. These applications shall also come up for hearing alongwith the appeal on that date.
</p><p>Order accordingly.
