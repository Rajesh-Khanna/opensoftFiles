<div><h3>Ramji Sharma & Anr. v State of Rajasthan and Others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>18 June 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.10606/2001
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Taken on board.
</p><p>1.  Having heard learned counsel on the question of admission, we are not inclined to entertain this petition under Article 136 of the Constitution the impugned order being an interim order passed by the Vacation Judge. The principal apprehension of the petitioner is that the respondents may try to delay the hearing and that may cause an irreparable damage to the interest of the petitioner.
</p><p>2.  To allay the apprehension of the petitioner, we request the High Court to hear and dispose of the matter 'on July 3, 2001 as a first case for final disposal at the admission stage' as directed by itself and keeping in view the interest of the students. The petition is dismissed subject to this observation.
</p><p>Petition dismissed.
