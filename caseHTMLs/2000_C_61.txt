This Court, after referring to the allotment order, the Administrator's letter dated 9-7-1993 in favour of the petitioner and the earlier conveyance deed dated 30-9-1981 in favour of the petitioner's husband came to the conclusion that the words "a residential plot or house" include a flat constructed for residential purposes on the 2nd or 3rd floor of a shop on the ground floor.
</p><p>4. The principle of purposeful interpretation was adopted and further taking notice of the fact that the concessional scheme is not intended to benefit more than one member of the family aforesaid.
