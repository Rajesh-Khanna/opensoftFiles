<div><h3>Ashok Plantations Private Limited v D.D. Ramesh and Others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>23 April 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20032-20033/2000
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  I.A. Nos.7, 8, 9 and 10 are allowed. As the LRs of respondent no.14 is already on record, no separate notice need be sent.
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>2.  We issue notice mainly on the limited ground as to whether the delay involved in filing the review petition filed before the High Court could be condoned.
</p><p>3.  After perusing the grounds urged in the application for condonation of delay in filing the review petition we are of the opinion that some latitude could have been granted to the appellant in the matter. It is only in the interest of justice that review petition is disposed of on merits. We, therefore, condone the delay involved in filing the review application.
</p><p>4. Accordingly that part of the impugned order (rejecting the application for condonation of delay) would stand set aside. The High Court will now dispose of the review petition in accordance with law after affording a reasonable opportunity to both parties for hearing.
</p><p>Appeals are disposed of accordingly.
</p><p>Appeals disposed of.
