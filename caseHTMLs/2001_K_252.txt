<div><h3>Ghanshyam Dass Taneja v Kurukshetra University and Others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>14 September 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20057/2000
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>Heard counsel for the parties.
</p><p>1.  This Court on numerous occasions has indicated that the High Court while dismissing a writ petition is required to give reasons, although it may be brief one.
</p><p>2. In this case we do not find any independent reasoning having given by the High Court while dismissing the writ petition and in its absence, the order under challenge deserves to be set aside. We, therefore, set aside the order and judgment under challenge and send the case back to the High Court to decide the matter after giving reasons thereof.
</p><p>3.  The appeal is allowed. There shall be no order as to costs.
</p><p>Appeal allowed.
