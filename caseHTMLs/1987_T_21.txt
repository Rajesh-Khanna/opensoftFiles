</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>9 January 1987
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No. 2061 of 1970
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  Notice was issued to the State of Himachal Pradesh. We think that the State of Himachal Pradesh need not be joined as a party. The name of State Himachal Pradesh will be deleted from the record inasmuch as Himachal Pradesh was never a party in the Lower Court. So far as the appellants are concerned since the heirs of the deceased respondents have not been brought on record by them notwithstanding the fact that opportunity was afforded from time to time to do the needful the appeal will stand disposed of as having abated.
</p><p>There will be no order regarding costs.
</p><p>Appeal disposed of.
