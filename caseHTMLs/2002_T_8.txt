</p><p>16.  One of the aforesaid applications has been filed by the State of Rajasthan seeking modification or clarification to the effect that the order dated 29-10-2002/30-10-2002 would be applicable only to illegal mines in the Aravalli Hills. IA No. 840 has been filed by M/s Gurgaon Sohna Mineral and another seeking similar relief. Applications have also been filed by the State of Haryana and other parties.
</p><p>17.  We have heard learned counsel. On 29-10-2002/30-10-2002 this Court prohibited and banned the mining activities in the entire Aravalli Hills. This ban, it was directed, is not limited only to the hills encircling Kote and Alampur Villages but extends to the entire hill range of Aravalli from Haryana to Rajasthan.
</p><p>18. The Chief Secretaries, State of Haryana and State of Rajasthan were directed to ensure that no mining activity in the Aravalli Hills is carried out, especially in that part which has been regarded as forest area or protected under the Environment (Protection) Act.
</p><p>19.  On consideration of the report of the Central Empowered Committee dated 14-12-2002, we issue the following further directions:
</p><p>(1) Mining may be permitted in forest areas where specific prior approval under Section 2 of the <a href="/acts/Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980">Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980</a> has been accorded by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India. However, in view of this Court's order dated 14-2-2000 passed in IA No. 548 no mining activity is permitted within areas which are notified as sanctuary, national park under Sections 18, 35 of the <a href="/acts/Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972">Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972</a> or any sanctuary, national park or game reserve declared under any other Act or rules made thereunder even if prior approval have been obtained from MoEF under the FC Act in such an area.
</p><p>(2) Under Notification dated 29-11-1999 issued under Section 23 of the Environment (Protection) Act for certain districts including Gurgaon District in the State of Haryana, the Ministry has delegated power to grant approval for mining purposes to the State. The mining activities are being regulated under the Notification dated 7-5-1992 issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (Annexure A-1 in IA No. 833). We direct that, for the time being, no mining shall be permitted within the areas of Gurgaon District in the State of Haryana where mining is regulated under the Notification dated 7-5-1992 issued under Section 3 of the Environment (Protection) Act, pursuant to permission granted after 29-11-1999.
</p><p>20. Meanwhile, the Central Empowered Committee which is examining the matter will give its suggestions within a period of six weeks. On the receipt of those suggestions, the prayers made by the applicants for modification of the order dated 29-10-2002/30-10-2002 insofar as Gurgaon District is concerned, will be considered.
</p><p>(5) No mining activity would be permitted in respect of areas where there is a dispute of applicability of the FC Act, till such time the dispute is resolved or approval under the FC Act is accorded, in addition to order already passed in Writ Petition No. 4677 of 1985.
</p><p>21.  For the present, no mining will be permitted in the areas for which notification under Sections 4 and 5 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900 has been issued for regulating the breaking up of the land, etc. and such lands are or were recorded as "forest" in government records even if the notification period has expired, unless there is approval under the FC Act.
</p><p>22.  Learned Attorney General and Solicitor General will assist the Court on the aforesaid aspects on the next date of hearing.
</p><p>23.  In respect of Suggestions 7 and 8, the Union of India will respond on the next date of hearing.
</p><p>24.  The order dated 29/30-10-2002, prohibiting and banning the mining activity in Aravalli Hills from Haryana to Rajasthan is modified insofar as the State of Rajasthan is concerned to the following effect:
</p><p>25. Wherever requisite approval/sanctions in the said State have been obtained under the FC Act and EP Act, and the mining is not prohibited under the applicable Acts or notifications or orders of the Court, mining can continue and to such mining the order aforesaid will not apply.
</p><p>26.  This order will be applicable to non-forest land covered for the period prior to the date of modification of the order dated 29-11-1999 in the State of Haryana.
</p><p>27.  This variation will not apply to the area in Alampur District in the State of Haryana.
</p><p>List the matter on 7-2-2003 at 2 o'clock.
</p><p>WPs (C) Nos. 672 of 1998 and 603 of 2000
</p><p>Adjourned to 7-2-2003.
</p><p>Order accordingly.
