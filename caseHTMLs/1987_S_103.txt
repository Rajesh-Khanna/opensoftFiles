<div><h3>Registrar, Osmania University and Another v Smt. A. Vijaya Govind and Another
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>9 March 1987
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No. 1637 of 1987 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 26 December 1986 of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in W.P. No. 15223 of 1986)
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  We do not propose to entertain this petition under Article 136 of the Constitution Of India,1950 but we however wish to make it clear that we do not agree with the view of the High Court that notwithstanding the fact that there are many other candidates who have obtained more marks than the petitioners before the High Court, she should be admitted into the college merely because the others have not also filed writ petitions. The view of the High Court is contrary to what this Court has said in Punjab Engineering College v. Sanjay Gulati <a href="/case/1983 Indlaw SC 89">1983 Indlaw SC 89</a>; State of Kerala v. Roshana <a href="/case/1979 Indlaw SC 2">1979 Indlaw SC 2</a>96 and other cases. But having regard to the time that has elapsed we do not propose to exercise our discretion under Article 136 of the Constitution.
</p><p>With this observation the special leave petition is dismissed.
</p><p>Petition dismissed.
