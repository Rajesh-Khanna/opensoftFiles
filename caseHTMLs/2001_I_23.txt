<div><h3>Sleeba John Chungath v Indian Bank and Others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>8  May  2001
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.3970-3971/2001
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Delay condoned.
</p><p>1.  An order of transfer was called in question by the petitioner before the High Court. The High Court while admitting the Writ Petition had granted stay of that order. That position continued until disposal of the Writ Petition and thereafter till disposal of the Writ Appeal on 28.7.2000.
</p><p>2. Therefore, for such a long period the order of transfer had not been given effect.
</p><p>3.  We do not think it would be appropriate to disturb that state of affairs for some more time.
</p><p>Let the order of transfer be kept in abeyance till 31st December, 2001. It is made clear that this order is made in the special features of this case. The petitions shall stand disposed of accordingly.
</p><p>Petitions disposed of.
