<div><h3>Sheenappa Rai v Rathnavathi and Others
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>19 February 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.18727/1999
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>1.  We have heard learned counsel and read the order under challenge. The order was passed on a first appeal and it reversed the decree passed in the trial court. It is, regretably, too sketchy an order for an order which reverses the trial court's order. We, therefore, are of the view that it must be set aside and the first appeal restored to the file of the High Court to be heard and disposed of afresh, after consideration in greater detail of the evidence and the contentions. The order passed thereon should reflect such consideration.
</p><p>2. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. The order under appeal is set aside. The First Appeal (R.F.A.No.50/1994) is restored to the file of the High Court of Karnataka to be heard and disposed of afresh, expeditiously. No order as to costs.
</p><p>Appeal allowed.
