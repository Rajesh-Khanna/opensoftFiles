<div><h3>Union of India v Ram Suia Sharma
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>15 February 1996
</b><p>
</p><p>Civil Appeal No. 3626 of 1996
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows :
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>1.  The controversy raised in this appeal is no longer res integra. In a series of judgments, this Court has held that a court or tribunal at the belated stage cannot entertain a claim for the correction of the date of birth duly entered in the service records. Admittedly, the respondent had joined the service on Decenber 16, 1962. After 25 years, he woke up and claimed that his correct date of birth is January 2, 1939 and not December 16, 1934. That claim was accepted by the Tribunal and it directed the Government to consider the correction. The direction is per se illegal.
</p><p>The appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs.
