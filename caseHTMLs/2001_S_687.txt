<div><h3>State of Haryana and Anr v Mohan Lal Contractor and Anr
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>26 March 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.8134/2000
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Leave granted.
</p><p>1.  We have heard learned counsel. It appears from the record before us that it was submitted on behalf of the first respondent before the trial court that the State of Haryana was not a necessary party and, therefore, it was given up. We find, however, that it is a necessary party and that its interests are affected.
</p><p>2. We think, in the circumstances, and with the concurrence of learned counsel before us, that the orders of the trial court and orders subsequent thereto should be set aside and the matter re-heard by the trial court, after making the State of Haryana a party.
</p><p>3.  The trial court will dispose of the matter expeditiously and so far as possible within six months from today.
</p><p>Order on the appeal accordingly. No order as to costs.
</p><p>Order accordingly.
