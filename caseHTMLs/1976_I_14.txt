<div><h3>State of West Bengal and Others v Indira Debi and Another
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>8 November 1976
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No. 1849 of 1968.
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows :
</p><p>1.  This appeal by certificate is against the judgment and order dated August 11, 1965 of the High Court of Calcutta.
</p><p>2.  This appeal turns on the validity of a notice u/s. 57 of the West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act, 1954, referred to as the Act. There is at the top of the notice in writing -"Case No. 124 under Section 151, Civil Procedure Code ".
</p><p>3.  It is obvious that reference to Section 151, Civil Procedure Code cannot be a source of power as far as notice u/s. 57 of the Act is concerned. S. 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not confer any additional jurisdiction on the Court. In so far as the Courts of Record and Civil Courts are concerned, they have their inherent power which is recognized by S. 151.
</p><p>4.  The parties accept that this notice be treated as notice u/s. 57 of the West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act, 1954  and it will be valid for the purposes mentioned under the said S. 57 of the Act.
</p><p>5.  It is made clear that whatever power the authorities have under the Act, they will be at liberty to call in aid only those powers for the purposes mentioned in the Act.
</p><p>6.  The High Court order is set aside and is modified to the extent indicated above and the appeal is disposed of.
</p><p>Parties will pay and bear their own costs throughout.
</p><p>Appeal disposed of.
