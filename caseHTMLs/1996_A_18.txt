<div><h3>Ahmedabad Manufacturing and Calico Printing Company and Another v A. V. Joshi
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>13 February 1996
</b><p>
</p><p>C.A. No. 1044 of 1979 with S.L.P. (C) No. 13353 of 1992
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  In the present case, the High Court has not followed the direct decision of this Court on Section 80-K of the Income Tax Act, 1961 in Union of India v. Coromandel Fertilizers Ltd. <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1975 Indlaw SC 3">1975 Indlaw SC 3</a>61"><a href="/case/1975 Indlaw SC 3">1975 Indlaw SC 3</a>61</a><a href="/case/<a href="/case/1975 Indlaw SC 3">1975 Indlaw SC 3</a>61"><a href="/case/1975 Indlaw SC 3">1975 Indlaw SC 3</a>61</a><a href="/case/<a href="/case/1975 Indlaw SC 3">1975 Indlaw SC 3</a>61"><a href="/case/1975 Indlaw SC 3">1975 Indlaw SC 3</a>61</a> which is by a Bench of two learned Judges. The High Court has referred to two later decisions of this Court in CIT v. Patiala Flour Mills Co. (P) Ltd. <a href="/case/1978 Indlaw SC 5">1978 Indlaw SC 5</a>14<a href="/case/1978 Indlaw SC 5">1978 Indlaw SC 5</a>14<a href="/case/1978 Indlaw SC 5">1978 Indlaw SC 5</a>14 and Rajapalayam Mills Ltd. v. CIT <a href="/case/1978 Indlaw SC 2">1978 Indlaw SC 2</a>18<a href="/case/1978 Indlaw SC 2">1978 Indlaw SC 2</a>18<a href="/case/1978 Indlaw SC 2">1978 Indlaw SC 2</a>18 by a Bench of three learned Judges on Section 80-J of the Act.
</p><p>2.   The latter decisions by a Bench of three Judges on Section 80-J do not say that the decision in Union of India v. Coromandel Fertilizers Ltd. <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1975 Indlaw SC 3">1975 Indlaw SC 3</a>61"><a href="/case/1975 Indlaw SC 3">1975 Indlaw SC 3</a>61</a><a href="/case/<a href="/case/1975 Indlaw SC 3">1975 Indlaw SC 3</a>61"><a href="/case/1975 Indlaw SC 3">1975 Indlaw SC 3</a>61</a><a href="/case/<a href="/case/1975 Indlaw SC 3">1975 Indlaw SC 3</a>61"><a href="/case/1975 Indlaw SC 3">1975 Indlaw SC 3</a>61</a> is not correct. In such a situation, it was inappropriate for the High Court to have itself treated the decision in Union of India v. Coromandel Fertilizers Ltd. <a href="/case/<a href="/case/1975 Indlaw SC 3">1975 Indlaw SC 3</a>61"><a href="/case/1975 Indlaw SC 3">1975 Indlaw SC 3</a>61</a><a href="/case/<a href="/case/1975 Indlaw SC 3">1975 Indlaw SC 3</a>61"><a href="/case/1975 Indlaw SC 3">1975 Indlaw SC 3</a>61</a><a href="/case/<a href="/case/1975 Indlaw SC 3">1975 Indlaw SC 3</a>61"><a href="/case/1975 Indlaw SC 3">1975 Indlaw SC 3</a>61</a> as incorrect when that is the decision directly on Section 80-K of the Act.
</p><p>However, in these circumstances, we consider it appropriate that these matters be heard by a three-Judge Bench.
</p><p>List the matters before a three-Judge Bench.
</p><p>Order accordingly.
