<div><h3>Supdt., Krishi Talahidi Balakara P. Shala v Yalagurdappa Basappa Amargol and Anr
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>2 February 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14762/2000
</p><p>The Order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>1.  In this matter, the Tribunal's Award stands affirmed by the learned Single Judge as also the Division Bench.
</p><p>2.  The issue as to whether the respondents are workmen or not need not be gone into at this juncture because admittedly they had worked for more than 240 days in a year and in view of the concurrent findings, we are not inclined to go into the issue at this juncture.
</p><p>As such this Petition fails and is dismissed.
</p><p>3. We, however, record our appreciation for the trouble taken by Mr.M.N.Rao, learned Senior Advocate who assisted this Court as an Amicus Curiae at our instance.
</p><p>Petition dismissed.
