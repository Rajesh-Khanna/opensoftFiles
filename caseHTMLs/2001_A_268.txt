<div><h3>Ashok Madhavrao Deshmukh v Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers Limited and
</h3><p>Supreme Court of India
</p><b>31 October 2001
</b><p>
</p><p>Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.18864/2001
</p><p>The order of the Court was as follows:
</p><p>Taken on Board.
</p><p>1.  The SLP is against an order of the High Court not granting any interim relief while the Writ Petition is pending. The question for consideration is before the High Court whether the age of superannuation is 58 or 60 years, as contended by the employee. In such a matter we see no justification for granting stay of an order of superannuation. The High Court therefore was justified in not granting any interim relief.
</p><p>The SLP is dismissed.
</p><p>2.  In view of the fact that the petitioner, in any event, even accepting his contention, would superannuate on attaining the age of 60 years. It would be meet and proper for the High Court to take up and dispose of the Writ Petition at an early date.
</p><p>Petition dismissed.
