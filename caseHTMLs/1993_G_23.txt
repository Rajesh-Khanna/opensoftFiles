</p><p>C.A. No. 5850 of 1983
</p><p>1.  This appeal is preferred by the Revenue against an order of the High Court of Bombay rejecting an application under section 256(2) of the <a href="/acts/Income-tax Act, 1961">Income-tax Act, 1961</a>. By the said application, the Revenue asked the court to direct the Tribunal to state the following two questions for the opinion of the High Court:
</p><p>"(1) Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in law in holding that, in computing the assessee's income for the year 1972-73, the provision for gratuity of Rs. 36,831 should be allowed as a deduction?
</p><p>(2) Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, and having regard to the fact that the entire gratuity liability of Rs. 2,51,710 has been allowed as a deduction in the year 1973-74 in accordance with the provisions of section 40A(7), the Tribunal ought to have held that no deduction by way of provision for gratuity should be allowed for the year 1972-73 ?"
</p><p>2.  The assessment year concerned is 1972-73. Sub-section (7) of section 40A is not applicable to the said assessment year. Sub-section (7) was introduced by the <a href="/acts/Finance Act, 1975">Finance Act, 1975</a>, with retrospective effect from April 1, 1973. In other words, sub-section (7) applies on and from the assessment year 1973-74.
</p><p>3.  The assessee claimed a deduction of Rs. 36,831 on account of the provision made by it for payment of gratuity to its employees for the accounting year relevant to the assessment year 1972-73.
</p><p>4. The deduction was allowed under section 37 of the Income-tax Act This was objected to by the Revenue and the aforesaid questions were sought to be raised.
</p><p>5.  We see no error in the order of the High Court refusing to direct the Tribunal to make a reference with respect to the admissibility of the said deduction. The appeal accordingly fails and is dismissed. No costs.
</p><p>Appeal dismissed.
